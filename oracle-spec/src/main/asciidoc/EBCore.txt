=== [#50561028_pgfId-1602477]##[#50561028_21623]##Introduction

[#50561028_pgfId-1602478]##This is the specification of the Enterprise
JavaBeans _TM_ architecture. The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture is a
architecture for the development and deployment of component-based
business applications. Applications written using the Enterprise
JavaBeans architecture are scalable, transactional, and multi-user
secure. These applications may be written once, and then deployed on any
server platform that supports the Enterprise JavaBeans specification.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1345965]##[#50561028_85589]##Target Audience

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-203942]##The target audiences for this specification
are the vendors of transaction processing platforms, vendors of
enterprise application tools, and other vendors who want to support the
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology in their products.

[#50561028_pgfId-203956]##Many concepts described in this document are
system-level issues that are transparent to the Enterprise JavaBeans
application programmer.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1686168]##[#50561028_80976]##What is New in This Release

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1728978]##Enhanced message-driven beans contract with a
no-methods message listener interface to expose all public methods as
message listener methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1728969]##Defined the EJB API Groups with clear rules
for an EJB Lite Container to support other API groups.

[#50561028_pgfId-1728970]##Added container provided security role named
“**” to indicate any authenticated caller independent of the actual role

javax.ejb.TimerHandle that required references to be used only inside a
bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727354]##Relaxed default rules for a session bean to
designate its implemented interfaces as local or as remote business
interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730475]##Enhanced the list of standard JMS MDB
activation properties.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730476]##Simplified requirements for definition of a
security role using the ejb deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730477]##Removed restriction on obtaining the current
class loader; replaced ‘must not’ with ‘should exercise caution’ when
using the Java I/O package.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1702462]##What was New in EJB 3.1

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1700599]##The Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_69371[See Enterprise JavaBeans™, version 3.1. (EJB
3.1). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.] architecture extended
Enterprise JavaBeans to include the following new functionality and
simplifications to the earlier EJB APIs:

[#50561028_pgfId-1642624]## _A simplified local view that provides
session bean access without a separate local business interface._

[#50561028_pgfId-1696551]##Packaging and deployment of EJB components
directly in a _.war_ file without an ejb-jar file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1696552]##An embeddable API for executing EJB
components within a Java SE environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1696553]## _A singleton session bean component that
provides easy access to shared state as well as application startup and
shutdown callbacks._

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1642522]##What was New in EJB 3.0

[#50561028_pgfId-1642521]##The Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 architecture
extended Enterprise JavaBeans to include the following new functionality
and simplifications to the earlier EJB APIs:

[#50561028_pgfId-1598455]## _Definition of the Java language metadata
annotations that can be used to annotate EJB applications. These
metadata annotations are targeted at simplifying the developer’s task,
at reducing the number of program classes and interfaces the developer
is required to implement, and at eliminating the need for the developer
to provide an EJB deployment descriptor._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598456]## _Specification of programmatic defaults,
including for metadata, to reduce the need for the developer to specify
common, expected behaviors and requirements on the EJB container. A
“configuration by exception” approach is taken whenever possible._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598457]## _Encapsulation of environmental dependencies
and JNDI access through the use of annotations, dependency injection
mechanisms, and simple lookup mechanisms._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598458]## _Simplification of the enterprise bean
types._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598459]##Elimination of the requirement for EJB
component interfaces for session beans. The required business interface
for a session bean can be a plain Java interface rather than an
EJBObject, EJBLocalObject, or java.rmi.Remote interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598463]## _Elimination of the requirement for home
interfaces for session beans._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598464]## _Simplification of entity persistence
through the Java Persistence API_ link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29642[See Java™
Persistence API, version 2.1. http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338.] _._
Support for light-weight domain modeling, including inheritance and
polymorphism.

annotations and XML deployment descriptor elements for the
object/relational mapping of persistent entities
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29642[See Java™ Persistence API, version 2.1.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1598466]## _A query language for Java Persistence that
is an extension to EJB QL, with addition of projection, explicit inner
and outer join operations, bulk update and delete, subqueries, and
group-by. Addition of a dynamic query capability and support for native
SQL queries._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598467]## _An interceptor facility for session beans
and message-driven beans._

[#50561028_pgfId-1598752]## _Reduction of the requirements for usage of
checked exceptions._

=== [#50561028_pgfId-1601599]##[#50561028_39170]##Overview

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1601606]##Overall Goals

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1601607]##The Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) architecture
has the following goals:

[#50561028_pgfId-1601608]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will be
the standard component architecture for building object-oriented
business applications in the Java™ programming language.

[#50561028_pgfId-1672771]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
support the development, deployment, and use of distributed business
applications in the Java™ programming language.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601610]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
support the development, deployment, and use of web services.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601611]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
make it easy to write applications: application developers will not have
to understand low-level transaction and state management details,
multi-threading, connection pooling, or other complex low-level APIs.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601612]##Enterprise JavaBeans applications will follow
the Write Once, Run Anywhere™ philosophy of the Java programming
language. An enterprise bean can be developed once, and then deployed on
multiple platforms without recompilation or source code modification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601613]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
address the development, deployment, and runtime aspects of an
enterprise application’s life cycle.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601614]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
define the contracts that enable tools from multiple vendors to develop
and deploy components that can interoperate at runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601615]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
make it possible to build applications by combining components developed
using tools from different vendors.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601616]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
provide interoperability between enterprise beans and Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition (Java EE) components as well as non-Java programming
language applications.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601617]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will be
compatible with existing server platforms. Vendors will be able to
extend their existing products to support Enterprise JavaBeans.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1601601]##[#50561028_15487]##EJB Roles

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1601602]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture defines
six distinct roles in the application development and deployment life
cycle. Each EJB role may be performed by a different party. The EJB
architecture specifies the contracts that ensure that the product of
each EJB role is compatible with the product of the other EJB roles. The
EJB specification focuses on those contracts that are required to
support the development and deployment of enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199784]##In some scenarios, a single party may perform
several EJB Roles. For example, the Container Provider and the EJB
Server Provider may be the same vendor. Or a single programmer may
perform the two EJB Roles of the Enterprise Bean Provider and the
Application Assembler.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199785]##The following sections define the six EJB
roleslink:#pgfId-1672343[1].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1317714]##Enterprise Bean Provider

[#50561028_pgfId-1317715]##[#50561028_marker-1317718]##The Enterprise
Bean Provider (Bean Provider for short) is the producer of enterprise
beans. His or her output is a set of one or more enterprise beans. These
beans may be contained in a ejb-jar

[#50561028_pgfId-1692194]##or may be contained directly in a .war file.
The Bean Provider is responsible for the Java classes that implement the
enterprise beans’ business methods; the definition of the beans’ client
view interfaces, if any; and the declarative specification of the beans’
metadata. The beans’ metadata may take the form of metadata annotations
applied to the bean classes and/or an external XML deployment
descriptor. The beans’ metadata—whether expressed in metadata
annotations or in the deployment descriptor—includes the structural
information of the enterprise beans and declares all the enterprise
beans’ external dependencies (e.g. the names and types of resources that
the enterprise beans use).

[#50561028_pgfId-1199787]##The Enterprise Bean Provider is typically an
application domain expert. The Bean Provider develops reusable
enterprise beans that typically implement business tasks or business
entities.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199788]##The Bean Provider is not required to be an
expert at system-level programming. Therefore, the Bean Provider usually
does not program transactions, concurrency, security, distribution, or
other services into the enterprise beans. The Bean Provider relies on
the EJB container for these services.

[#50561028_pgfId-1256150]##A Bean Provider of multiple enterprise beans
often performs the EJB role of the Application Assembler.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199790]##Application Assembler

[#50561028_pgfId-1689332]##[#50561028_marker-1689330]##The Application
Assembler combines enterprise beans into larger deployable application
units. The input to the Application Assembler is a set of enterprise
beans, their interfaces, and metadata, as produced by the Bean
Provider(s). The Bean Provider's output may also simply be un-assembled
enterprise beans that must be packaged in an ejb-jar file or _.war_
file. The Application Assembler may insert the application assembly
instructions into the deployment descriptors. The Application Assembler
will create one or more ejb-jar and/or _.war_ files from the input
artifacts together with their application assembly instructions as
needed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1689366]##All of the input could be combined into a
single output ejb-jar file or _.war_ file. Similarly, the input could
also be split into multiple output ejb-jar and/or _.war_ files. For
example, the Application Assembler could combine ejb1.jar and ejb2.jar
into ejb3.jar, combine ejb1.jar and web1.war into web2.war, split
ejb1.jar into ejb2.jar and ejb3.jar, split web1.war into ejb1.jar and
web2.jar, and so forth. Each output ejb-jar file or _.war_ file is
either a deployment unit intended for the Deployer or a partially
assembled application that is intended for another Application
Assembler.

[#50561028_pgfId-1689345]##The Application Assembler can also combine
enterprise beans with other types of application components when
composing an application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1247069]##The EJB specification describes the case in
which the application assembly step occurs before the deployment of the
enterprise beans. However, the EJB architecture does not preclude the
case that application assembly is performed after the deployment of all
or some of the enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199791]##The Application Assembler is a domain expert
who composes applications that use enterprise beans. The Application
Assembler works with the enterprise beans’ metadata annotations and/or
deployment descriptor and the enterprise beans’ client-view contract.
Although the Assembler must be familiar with the functionality provided
by the enterprise beans’ client-view, he or she does not need to have
any knowledge of the enterprise beans’ implementation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199794]##Deployer

[#50561028_pgfId-1247086]##[#50561028_marker-1317747]##The Deployer
takes one or more ejb-jar files and/or .war file produced by a Bean
Provider or Application Assembler and deploys the enterprise beans
contained in the ejb-jar files or .war files in a specific operational
environment. The operational environment includes an EJB container and
server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1247097]##The Deployer must resolve all the external
dependencies declared by the Bean Provider (e.g. the Deployer must
ensure that all resource manager connection factories used by the
enterprise beans are present in the operational environment, and he or
she must bind them to the resource manager connection factory references
declared in the metadata annotations or deployment descriptor), and must
follow the application assembly instructions defined by the Application
Assembler. To perform his or her role, the Deployer uses tools provided
by the EJB Container Provider.

[#50561028_pgfId-1247087]##The Deployer’s output is a set of enterprise
beans (or an assembled application that includes enterprise beans) that
have been customized for the target operational environment, and that
are deployed in a specific EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1246973]##The Deployer is an expert at a specific
operational environment and is responsible for the deployment of
enterprise beans. For example, the Deployer is responsible for mapping
the security roles defined by the Bean Provider or Application Assembler
to the user groups and accounts that exist in the operational
environment in which the enterprise beans are deployed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210318]##The Deployer uses tools supplied by the EJB
Container Provider to perform the deployment tasks. The deployment
process is typically two-stage:

[#50561028_pgfId-1210320]##The Deployer first generates the additional
classes and interfaces that enable the container to manage the
enterprise beans at runtime. These classes are container-specific.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210321]##The Deployer performs the actual installation
of the enterprise beans and the additional classes and interfaces into
the EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199797]##In some cases, a qualified Deployer may
customize the business logic of the enterprise beans at their
deployment. Such a Deployer would typically use the Container Provider’s
tools to write relatively simple application code that wraps the
enterprise beans’ business methods.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199799]##EJB Server Provider

[#50561028_pgfId-1317761]##[#50561028_marker-1317762]##The EJB Server
Provider is a specialist in the area of distributed transaction
management, distributed objects, and other lower-level system-level
services.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199801]##The current EJB architecture assumes that the
EJB Server Provider and the EJB Container Provider roles are the same
vendor. Therefore, it does not define any interface requirements for the
EJB Server Provider.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199810]##EJB Container Provider

[#50561028_pgfId-1247011]##[#50561028_marker-1317778]##The EJB Container
Provider (Container Provider for short) provides:

[#50561028_pgfId-1317672]##The deployment tools necessary for the
deployment of enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1317675]##The runtime support for the deployed
enterprise bean instances.

[#50561028_pgfId-1256145]##From the perspective of the enterprise beans,
the container is a part of the target operational environment. The
container runtime provides the deployed enterprise beans with
transaction and security management, network distribution of remote
clients, scalable management of resources, and other services that are
generally required as part of a manageable server platform.

[#50561028_pgfId-1252394]##The “EJB Container Provider’s
responsibilities” defined by the EJB architecture are meant to be
requirements for the implementation of the EJB container and server.
Since the EJB specification does not architect the interface between the
EJB container and server, it is left up to the vendor how to split the
implementation of the required functionality between the EJB container
and server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199811]##The expertise of the Container Provider is
system-level programming, possibly combined with some application-domain
expertise. The focus of a Container Provider is on the development of a
scalable, secure, transaction-enabled container that is integrated with
an EJB server. The Container Provider insulates the enterprise bean from
the specifics of an underlying EJB server by providing a simple,
standard API between the enterprise bean and the container. This API is
the Enterprise JavaBeans component contract.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199813]##The Container Provider typically provides
support for versioning the installed enterprise bean components. For
example, the Container Provider may allow enterprise bean classes to be
upgraded without invalidating existing clients or losing existing
enterprise bean objects.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199814]##The Container Provider typically provides
tools that allow the System Administrator to monitor and manage the
container and the beans running in the container at runtime.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199816]##System Administrator

[#50561028_pgfId-1247109]##[#50561028_marker-1317792]##The System
Administrator is responsible for the configuration and administration of
the enterprise’s computing and networking infrastructure that includes
the EJB server and container. The System Administrator is also
responsible for overseeing the well-being of the deployed enterprise
beans applications at runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199851]##Enterprise JavaBeans is an architecture for
component-based transaction-oriented enterprise applications.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199852]##Characteristics of Enterprise Beans

[#50561028_pgfId-1199853]##[#50561028_marker-1317806]##The essential
characteristics of an enterprise bean are:

[#50561028_pgfId-1199854]##An enterprise bean typically contains
business logic that operates on the enterprise’s data.

[#50561028_pgfId-1265444]##An enterprise bean’s instances are managed at
runtime by a container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199855]##An enterprise bean can be customized at
deployment time by editing its environment entries.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199856]##Various service information, such as
transaction and security attributes, may be specified together with the
business logic of the enterprise bean class in the form of metadata
annotations, or separately, in an XML deployment descriptor. This
service information may be extracted and managed by tools during
application assembly and deployment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1301398]##Client access is mediated by the container in
which the enterprise bean is deployed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199858]##If an enterprise bean uses only the services
defined by the EJB specification, the enterprise bean can be deployed in
any compliant EJB container. Specialized containers can provide
additional services beyond those defined by the EJB specification. An
enterprise bean that depends on such a service can be deployed only in a
container that supports that service.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199860]##An enterprise bean can be included in an
assembled application without requiring source code changes or
recompilation of the enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199861]##The Bean Provider defines a client view of an
enterprise bean. The Bean Provider can manually define the client view
or it can be generated automatically by application development tools.
The client view is unaffected by the container and server in which the
bean is deployed. This ensures that both the beans and their clients can
be deployed in multiple execution environments without changes or
recompilation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1199862]##Flexible Model

[#50561028_pgfId-1199863]##The enterprise bean architecture is flexible
enough to implement the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1199864]##An object that represents a stateless
service.

[#50561028_pgfId-1347711]##An object that represents a stateless service
and that implements a web service endpoint.

[#50561028_pgfId-1549285]##An object that represents a stateless service
and whose invocation is asynchronous, driven by the arrival of messages.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199865]##An object that represents a conversational
session with a particular client. Such session objects automatically
maintain their conversational state across multiple client-invoked
methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1282730]##[#50561028_marker-1317820]##Enterprise beans
that are remotely accessible components are intended to be relatively
coarse-grained business objects or services (e.g. shopping cart, stock
quote service). In general, fine-grained objects should not be modeled
as remotely accessible components.

[#50561028_pgfId-1347715]##Although the state management protocol
defined by the Enterprise JavaBeans architecture is simple, it provides
an enterprise bean developer great flexibility in managing a bean’s
state.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1361356]##Enterprise Bean Object Types

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1361357]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture defines
the following types of enterprise bean objects:

[#50561028_pgfId-1361358]##Session objects.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598707]##Message-driven objects.

[#50561028_pgfId-1672422]##Entity objects (optional).

[#50561028_pgfId-1672426]##Support for session objects and
message-driven objects is required by this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1684652]##Earlier versions of the Enterprise JavaBeans
specification required support for entity bean _components_ (not to be
confused with the light-weight persistent entities defined by the Java
Persistence API). Support for entity bean components has been made
optional for an implementation as of the 3.2 version of the EJB
specification and is described in the EJB Optional Features document

[#50561028_pgfId-1199964]##A typical [#50561028_marker-1492028]##session
object has the following characteristics:

[#50561028_pgfId-1199965]##Executes on behalf of a single client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199966]##Can be transaction-aware.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199967]##Updates shared data in an underlying
database.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199968]##Does not represent directly shared data in
the database, although it may access and update such data.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199969]##May be relatively short-lived, or may have
the same lifetime as that of the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199970]##Is removed when the EJB container crashes.
The client has to re-establish a new session object to continue
computation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199971]##A typical EJB container provides a scalable
runtime environment to execute a large number of session objects
concurrently.

[#50561028_pgfId-1265885]##The EJB specification defines _stateful_ ,
stateless, and singleton session beans. There are differences in the API
between stateful session beans, stateless session beans, and singleton
session beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1199974]##A typical [#50561028_marker-1492029]##entity
object has the following characteristics:

[#50561028_pgfId-1199975]##Is part of a domain model, providing an
object view of data in the database.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210413]##Can be long-lived (lives as long as the data
in the database).

[#50561028_pgfId-1210414]##The entity and its primary key survive the
crash of the EJB container. If the state of an entity was being updated
by a transaction at the time the container crashed, the entity’s state
is restored to the state of the last committed transaction when the
entity is next retrieved.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200129]##[#50561028_marker-1317997]##For a client, a
session object is a non-persistent object that implements some business
logic running on the server. One way to think of a session object is as
a logical extension of the client program that runs on the server. A
stateless or stateful session bean object is not shared among multiple
clients.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673103]##A client can invoke a session bean
synchronously or asynchronously. An asynchronous method can return a
Future<V> object that allows the client to retrieve a result value,
check for exceptions, or attempt to cancel an in-progress invocation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673104]##From its creation until destruction, a
session object lives in a container. The container provides security,
concurrency, transactions, swapping to secondary storage, and other
services for the session object transparently to the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673105]##Each session object has an identity which, in
general, _does not_ survive a crash and restart of the container,
although a high-end container implementation can mask container and
server crashes to a remote or web service client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200130]##A client never directly accesses instances of
the session bean’s class. [#50561028_marker-1318011]##A client accesses
a session object through the session bean’s client view.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673114]##The client view of a session object is
independent of the implementation of the session bean and the container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599143]##The client of a session bean may be a local
client, a remote client, or a web service client, depending on the
view(s) provided by the bean and used by the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673132]##Multiple enterprise beans can be installed in
a container. The container allows the clients of session beans that
provide local or remote client views to obtain the business interfaces
and/or home interfaces of the installed enterprise beans through
dependency injection or to look them up via JNDI.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673121]##While it is possible to provide more than one
client view for a session bean, typically only one will be provided.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599110]##A [#50561028_marker-1599109]##remote client
of an session bean can be another enterprise bean deployed in the same
or different container; or it can be an arbitrary Java program, such as
an application, applet, or servlet. The client view of a session bean
can also be mapped to non-Java client environments, such as CORBA
clients that are not written in the Java programming language.

[#50561028_pgfId-1644860]##The interface used by a remote client of a
session bean is implemented by the container as a remote business
interface (or a remote EJBObject interface), and the
[#50561028_marker-1644861]##remote client view of a session bean is
location-independent. A client running in the same JVM as the session
object uses the same API as a client running in a different JVM on the
same or different machine.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599113]##Use of a session bean’s local client view
entails the collocation of the local client and the session. The local
client of an enterprise bean must be collocated in the same container as
the bean. The local client view is not location-independent.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599152]##The client of a stateless session bean or
singleton session bean may be a web service client. Only a _stateless_
session bean or singleton session bean may provide a web service client
view. A web service client makes use of the enterprise bean’s web
service client view, as described by a WSDL document. The bean’s client
view web service endpoint is in terms of a JAX-WS endpoint

[#50561028_pgfId-1598829]##This section describes some of the
considerations the Bean Provider should take into account in determining
the client view to provide for an enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673187]## _Terminology note_ _:_

[#50561028_pgfId-1673188]##EJB 3.0 significantly simplified the client
view of a session bean. This specification distinguishes among the
client view interfaces that were defined by the EJB 3.0 and later API
and the EJB 2.1 and earlier API as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1673189]## _The term_ _remote business interface_ _is
used to refer to the business interface of an EJB 3.x session bean that
supports remote access._

[#50561028_pgfId-1673190]## _The term_ _remote component interface_ _is
used to refer to the remote component interface of the EJB 2.1 client
view. This interface is an EJBObject interface._

[#50561028_pgfId-1673191]## _The term_ _local business interface_
_refers to the local business interface of an EJB 3.x session bean that
supports local access._

[#50561028_pgfId-1673192]## _The term_ _local component interface_ _is
used to refer to the local component interface of the EJB 2.1 client
view. This interface is an EJBLocalObject interface._

[#50561028_pgfId-1681048]##The term _business interface_ is used to
refer to a local or remote business interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1681049]##The term _component interface_ is used to
refer to a local or remote component interface (EJBLocalObject or
EJBObject interface).

[#50561028_pgfId-1675730]##The term _business method_ is used to refer
to a method of an enterprise bean that is available for client
execution. It may be a method exposed by the local or remote business
interface, by the no-interface view, by the local component interface,
by the remote component interface, or by the web service client view.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1598846]##[#50561028_57052]##Remote Clients

[#50561028_pgfId-1673232]##The [#50561028_marker-1673231]##remote client
view of an enterprise bean is location independent. A client running in
the same JVM as a bean instance uses the same API to access the bean as
a client running in a different JVM on the same or different machine.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673233]##The arguments and results of the methods of
the remote interfaces are passed by value.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598849]##For a session bean client and component
written to the EJB 3.x API, a [#50561028_marker-1598847]##remote client
accesses a session bean through the bean’s
[#50561028_marker-1598848]##remote business interface. For a session
bean client and component written to the EJB 2.1 and earlier APIs, the
remote client accesses the session bean through the session bean’s
remote home and remote component interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1600463]##The EJB 2.1 and earlier API required that a
remote client access the stateful or stateless session bean by means of
the session bean’s remote home and remote component interfaces. These
interfaces remain available for use with EJB 3.x beans, and are
described in Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_61795[See Remote and Local
Client View of Session Beans Written to the EJB 2.1 Client View API].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1598859]##[#50561028_29948]##Local Clients

[#50561028_pgfId-1598861]##Session beans may have local clients. A
[#50561028_marker-1598860]##local client is a client that is collocated
in the same JVM with the session bean that provides the local client
view and which may be tightly coupled to the bean. A local client of a
session bean may be another enterprise bean or a web component.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598862]##Access to an enterprise bean through the
local client view requires the collocation in the same JVM of both the
local client and the enterprise bean that provides the local client
view. The local client view therefore does not provide the
[#50561028_marker-1598863]##location transparency provided by the remote
client view.

[#50561028_pgfId-1646463]##Access to an enterprise bean through the
local client view is only required to be supported for local clients
packaged within the same application as the enterprise bean that
provides the local client view. Compliant implementations of this
specification may optionally support access to the local client view of
an enterprise bean from a local client packaged in a different
application. The configuration requirements for inter-application access
to the local client view are vendor-specific and are outside the scope
of this specification. Applications relying on inter-application access
to the local client view are non-portable.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673245]##The arguments and results of the methods of
the local client view are passed “by reference”link:#pgfId-1673241[2].
Enterprise beans that provide a local client view should therefore be
coded to assume that the state of any Java object that is passed as an
argument or result is potentially shared by caller and callee.

[#50561028_pgfId-1691278]##The Bean Provider must be aware of the
potential sharing of objects passed through invocations of the local
client view. In particular, the Bean Provider must be careful that the
state of one enterprise bean is not assigned as the state of another. In
general, the references that are passed across invocations of the local
client view cannot be used outside of the immediate call chain and must
never be stored as part of the state of another enterprise bean. The
Bean Provider must also exercise caution in determining which objects to
pass across the local view. This caution applies particularly in the
case where there is a change in transaction or security context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598866]##For a session bean client and component
written to the EJB 3.x API, a local client accesses a session bean
through the bean’s [#50561028_marker-1598864]##local business interface
or through a no-interface client view representing all non-static public
methods of the bean class. For a session bean client and component
written to the EJB 2.1 and earlier APIs, the local client accesses the
enterprise bean through the bean’s local home and local component
interfaces. The container object that implements a local interface or
the no-interface local view is a local Java object.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601823]##The EJB 2.1 and earlier API required that a
local client access a stateful or stateless session bean by means of the
session bean’s local home and local component interfaces. These
interfaces remain available for use with EJB 3.x beans, and are
described in Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_61795[See Remote and Local
Client View of Session Beans Written to the EJB 2.1 Client View API].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1598877]##[#50561028_30590]##Choosing Between a Local or Remote Client View

[#50561028_pgfId-1598879]##The following considerations should be taken
into account in determining whether a local or
[#50561028_marker-1598878]##remote access should be used for an
enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598881]##The remote programming model provides
location independence and flexibility with regard to the distribution of
components in the deployment environment. It provides a loose coupling
between the client and the bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598883]##[#50561028_marker-1598882]##Remote calls
involve pass-by-value. This copy semantics provides a layer of isolation
between caller and callee, and protects against the inadvertant
modification of data. The client and the bean may be programmed to
assume this parameter copying.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598884]##Remote calls are potentially expensive. They
involve network latency, overhead of the client and server software
stacks, argument copying, etc. Remote calls are typically programmed in
a coarse-grained manner with few interactions between the client and
bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598885]##The objects that are passed as parameters on
remote calls must be serializable.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598886]##When the EJB 2.1 and earlier remote home and
remote component interfaces are used, the narrowing of remote types
requires the use of javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow rather than
Java language casts.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598887]##Remote calls may involve error cases due to
communication, resource usage on other servers, etc., which are not
expected in local calls. When the EJB 2.1 and earlier remote home and
remote component interfaces are used, the client has to explicitly
program handlers for handling the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1598888]##Because of the overhead of the remote
programming model, it is typically used for relatively coarse-grained
component access.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598890]##[#50561028_marker-1598889]##Local calls
involve pass-by-reference. The client and the bean may be programmed to
rely on pass-by-reference semantics. For example, a client may have a
large document which it wants to pass on to the bean to modify, and the
bean further passes on. In the local programming model the sharing of
state is possible. On the other hand, when the bean wants to return a
data structure to the client but the bean does not want the client to
modify it, the bean explicitly copies the data structure before
returning it, while in the remote programming model the bean does not
copy the data structure because it assumes that the system will do the
copy.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598891]##Because local calls involve
pass-by-reference, the local client and the enterprise bean providing
the local client view are collocated.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598894]##The [#50561028_marker-1598892]##collocation
entailed by the [#50561028_marker-1598893]##local programming model
means that the enterprise bean cannot be deployed on a node different
from that of its client—thus restricting the distribution of components.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598895]##Because the local programming model provides
more lightweight access to a component, it better supports more
fine-grained component access.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598896]##Note that although collocation of the remote
client and the enterprise bean may allow the container to reduce the
overhead of calls through a remote business interface or remote
component interface, such calls are still likely to be less efficient
than calls made using a local interface because any optimizations based
on collocation must be done transparently.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598897]##The choice between the local and the remote
programming model is a design decision that the Bean Provider makes when
developing the enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598899]##While it is possible to provide both a remote
client view and a local client view for an enterprise bean, more
typically only one or the other will be provided.

[#50561028_pgfId-1598906]##Stateless session beans and singleton session
beans may have web service clients.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601849]##A web service client accesses a session bean
through the web service client view. The web service client view is
described by the WSDL document for the web service that the bean
implements. WSDL is an XML format for describing a web service as a set

service is bound to an XML based protocol (SOAP

scenarios that may be used for EJB web service endpoints.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673263]##EJB 2.1 required the Bean Provider to define

client view in addition to other client views for an enterprise bean,
more typically only one will be provided. There is no prohibition

[#50561028_pgfId-1601901]##The EJB 3.x local or remote client of a
session bean written to the EJB 3.x API accesses a session bean through
its business interface. The business interface of an EJB 3.x session
bean is an ordinary Java interface, regardless of whether local or
remote access is provided for the bean. In particular, the EJB 3.x
session bean business interface is not one of the interface types
required by earlier versions of the EJB specification (i.e., EJBObject
or EJBLocalObject interface). A local client may also access a session
bean through a no-interface view that exposes all non-static public
methods of the bean class.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1599183]##Obtaining a Session Bean’s Business Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1599185]##[#50561028_marker-1599184]##A client can
obtain a session bean’s business interface through dependency injection
or lookup in the JNDI namespace.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599226]##For example, the business interface _Cart_
for the _CartBean_ session bean may be obtained using dependency
injection as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1599231]##@EJB Cart cart;

[#50561028_pgfId-1599232]##The _Cart_ business interface could also be
looked up using JNDI as shown in the following code segment using the
_lookup_ method provided by the _EJBContext_ interface. In this example,
a reference to the client bean’s _SessionContext_ object is obtained
through dependency injection:

[#50561028_pgfId-1599187]##@Resource SessionContext ctx;

[#50561028_pgfId-1635103]##...

[#50561028_pgfId-1599245]##Cart cart = (Cart)ctx.lookup("cart");

[#50561028_pgfId-1642407]##In both cases, the syntax used in obtaining
the reference to the _Cart_ business interface is independent of whether
the business interface is local or remote. In the case of remote access,
the actual location of a referenced enterprise bean and EJB container
are, in general, transparent to the client using the remote business
interface of the bean.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1642411]##Obtaining a Reference to the No-interface View

[#50561028_pgfId-1642412]##A client can obtain a reference to a session
bean’s no-interface view through dependency injection or lookup in the
JNDI namespace.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642455]##For example, the no-interface view of the
_CartBean_ session bean with bean class _com.acme.CartBean_ may be
obtained using dependency injection as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1642429]##@EJB CartBean cart;

[#50561028_pgfId-1642430]##The _CartBean_ no-interface view could also
be looked up via JNDI as shown in the following code segment using the

[#50561028_pgfId-1642464]##...

[#50561028_pgfId-1642470]##CartBean cart = (CartBean)ctx.lookup("cart");

[#50561028_pgfId-1642471]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1642478]##Despite the fact that the client reference
for the no-interface view has the type of the bean class, the client
never directly uses the _new_ operator to acquire the reference.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599587]##The session bean’s business interface is an
ordinary Java interface. It contains the business methods of the session
bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599594]##A reference to a session bean’s business
interface may be passed as a parameter or return value of a business
interface method. If the reference is to a session bean’s local business
interface, the reference may only be passed as a parameter or return
value of a local business interface method or a no-interface view
method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599598]##The business interface of a stateful session

[#50561028_pgfId-1642493]##A session bean’s no-interface view is a
variation of the local view that exposes the non-static public methods
of the bean class without the use of a separate business interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642494]##A reference to the no-interface view may be
passed as a parameter or return value of any local business interface or
no-interface view method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642503]##The container provides an implementation of a
reference to a no-interface view such that when the client invokes a
method on the reference, the business method on the session bean
instance and any interceptor methods are invoked as needed. As with the
session bean remote and local views, a client acquires a no-interface
view reference via lookup or injection only. A client does not directly
instantiate (use the new operator on) the bean class to acquire a
reference to the no-interface view.

[#50561028_pgfId-1663975]##Only public methods of the bean class and of
any superclasses except java.lang.Object may be invoked through the
no-interface view. Attempted invocations of methods with any other
access modifiers via the no-interface view reference must result in the
javax.ejb.EJBException.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649643]##When interacting with a reference to the
no-interface view, the client must not make any assumptions regarding
the internal implementation of the reference, such as any
instance-specific state that may be present in the reference. Although
the reference object is type-compatible with the corresponding bean
class type, there is no prescribed relationship between the internal
implementation of the reference and the implementation of the bean
instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649704]##The developer of an enterprise bean that
exposes a no-interface view must not make any assumptions about the
number of times the bean class no-arg constructor will be called. For
example, it is possible that the acquisition of a client reference to
the no-interface view will result in the invocation of the bean class
constructor. It is recommended that the Bean Provider place component
initialization logic in a PostConstruct method instead of the bean class
no-arg constructor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645454]##By default, session bean invocations through
the remote, local, and no-interface views are synchronous. The client
blocks for the duration of the invocation and is returned control only
after all invocation processing has completed. Clients can achieve
asynchronous invocation behavior by invoking session bean methods that
have been designed to support asynchrony.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645456]##When a client invokes an asynchronous method,
the container returns control to the client immediately and continues
processing the invocation on a separate thread of execution.

exception (in the form of the javax.ejb.EJBException) on the client
thread if the container has problems allocating the internal resources
required to support the asynchronous method.link:#pgfId-1664231[6] If a
system exception is received on the client thread, the client can expect
that the container will not be able to dispatch the asynchronous method.
The client may wish to retry the asynchronous method at a later time.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652213]##If no system exception is received, the
client can expect that the container will make an attempt to dispatch
the asynchronous method. An exception resulting from the asynchronous
method execution (e.g. an authorization failure, transaction commit
failure, application exception, etc.) will be available via the
_Future<V>_ object.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1645485]##Return Values

[#50561028_pgfId-1645486]##Asynchronous methods have a return type of
void or Future<V>, where V represents the result value of the
asynchronous invocation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645473]##For Future<V>, the object returned from the
client invocation is a container provided object. This object allows the
client to retrieve the invocation result value, discover any invocation
exception, or attempt to cancel the asynchronous invocation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652572]##All methods of the
java.util.concurrent.Future interface are supported. Unless otherwise
noted, the behavior matches that described in its javadoc entry

Specification (Java SE).

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1652606]##Future.cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)

[#50561028_pgfId-1652610]##If a client calls cancel on its Future
object, the container will attempt to cancel the associated asynchronous
invocation only if that invocation has not already been dispatched.
There is no guarantee that an asynchronous invocation can be cancelled,
regardless of how quickly cancel is called after the client receives its
Future object. If the asynchronous invocation cannot be cancelled, the
method must return false. If the asynchronous invocation is successfully
cancelled, the method must return true.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652564]##The mayInterruptIfRunning flag controls
whether, in the case that the asynchronous invocation can not be
cancelled, the target enterprise bean should have visibility to the
client’s cancel attempt. If the mayInterruptIfRunning flag is set to
true, then subsequent calls to the SessionContext.wasCancelCalled method
from within the associated dispatched asynchronous invocation must
return true. If the mayInterruptIfRunning flag is set to false, then
subsequent calls to the SessionContext.wasCancelCalled method from
within the associated dispatched asynchronous invocation must return
false.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652775]##Note that all the client Future cancel
semantics (isCancelled, CancellationException, etc.) depend only on the
result of Future.cancel. If the dispatched asynchronous method does
decide to short circuit its processing as a result of checking
SessionContext, it is the responsibility of the Bean Provider to decide
how to convey that information to the client. Typically, that is done
through a special return value or exception delivered via Future.get().

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1652700]##Future.get

[#50561028_pgfId-1652707]##The client calls one of the two Future.get
methods in order to retrieve the result value or resulting exception
from the associated asynchronous invocation. This specification
recommends that unless the client successfully cancels the asynchronous
invocation it should call get on every Future object it receives. If a
call to get successfully returns a result value or throws an
ExecutionException, all subsequent calls to get on the same Future
object must result in that same behavior.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652718]##The EJB Container Provider is permitted to
define a timeout value that governs the maximum amount of time the
container maintains result values for completed asynchronous
invocations. The configuration of such a timeout is beyond the scope of
this specification.

reference and attempt to invoke the same reference object concurrently
from multiple threads. However, the resulting client behavior on each
thread depends on the concurrency semantics of the target bean. See

[#50561028_pgfId-1200143]##The EJB 2.1 and earlier specifications
required that the client first obtain a reference to a session bean’s
home interface, and then use the home interface to obtain a reference to
the bean’s component interface. This earlier programming model continues
to be supported by this specification. Both dependency injection and use
of the EJBContext _lookup_ method may be used as an alternative to the
JNDI APIs to obtain a reference to the home interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599280]##For example, an EJB 3.x client,
_com.acme.example.MySessionBean_ , might obtain a reference to a bean’s
home interface as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1610812]##The following code segments illustrate how
the home interface is obtained when the JNDI APIs are used directly, as

EJBHome object. The container makes the session bean’s remote home
interface available to the client through dependency injection or
through lookup in the JNDI namespace.

[#50561028_pgfId-1310892]##The remote home interface allows a client to
do the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1200198]##Create a new session object.

[#50561028_marker-1492057]## interface for the session bean. The

allow loose client/server binding and client-side scripting.

for the remote home interface. The [#50561028_marker-1492058]##home
handle can be serialized and written to stable storage. Later, possibly
in a different JVM, the handle can be deserialized from stable storage
and used to obtain back a reference of the remote home interface.

implementing the remote home interface (the EJBHome object) or the local
Java object implementing the local home interface (the EJBLocalHome

obtain a home interface, and then use it multiple times, during the
client application’s lifetime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1599376]##A client can pass a remote home object
reference to another application. The receiving application can use the
home interface in the same way that it would use a remote home object

[#50561028_pgfId-1200322]##A client creates a remote _Cart_ session
object, which provides a shopping service, using a create<METHOD> method
of the _Cart_ ’s remote home interface. The client then uses this
session object to fill the cart with items and to purchase its contents.

[#50561028_pgfId-1301477]##Suppose that the end-user wishes to start the
shopping session, suspend the shopping session temporarily for a day or
two, and later complete the session. The client might implement this
feature by getting the session object’s handle, saving the serialized
handle in persistent storage, and using it later to reestablish access
to the original _Cart_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1200324]##For the following example, we start by
looking up the _Cart_ ’s remote home interface in JNDI. We then use the
remote home interface to create a _Cart_ session object and add a few
items to it:

[#50561028_pgfId-1200325]##CartHome cartHome =
(CartHome)javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow(

[#50561028_pgfId-1200326]## initialContext.lookup(...), CartHome.class);

[#50561028_pgfId-1200328]##cart.addItem(66);

[#50561028_pgfId-1200329]##cart.addItem(22);

[#50561028_pgfId-1200330]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1200331]##Next we decide to complete this shopping
session at a later time so we serialize a handle to this cart session
object and store it in a file:

[#50561028_pgfId-1200332]##Handle cartHandle = cart.getHandle();

[#50561028_pgfId-1200333]## _//_ _serialize cartHandle, store in a
file..._

[#50561028_pgfId-1200334]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1200335]##Finally we deserialize the handle at a later
time, re-create the reference to the cart session object, and purchase
the contents of the shopping cart:

[#50561028_pgfId-1200336]##Handle cartHandle = ...; _// deserialize from
a file..._

[#50561028_pgfId-1673492]##[#50561028_marker-1673491]##Session objects
are intended to be private resources used only by the client that
created them. For this reason, session objects, from the client’s
perspective, appear anonymous. Session objects do not expose their
identity as a primary key, on the opposite, they hide their identity. As
a result, the _EJBObject.getPrimaryKey()_ [#50561028_marker-1673493]##
method results in a _java.rmi.RemoteException_ and the
_EJBLocalObject.getPrimaryKey()_ [#50561028_marker-1673494]## method
results in a _javax.ejb.EJBException_ , and the _EJBHome.remove(Object_
_primaryKey)_ and the _EJBLocalHome.remove(Object primaryKey)_ methods
result in a _javax.ejb.RemoveException_ if called on a session bean. If
the _EJBMetaData.getPrimaryKeyClass()_ method is invoked on a
EJBMetaData object for a session bean, the method throws the
_java.lang.RuntimeException_ .Since all session objects hide their
identity, there is no need to provide a finder for them. The home
interface of a session bean must not define any finder methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1673496]##A session object handle can be held beyond
the life of a client process by serializing the handle to persistent
storage. When the handle is later deserialized, the session object it
returns will work as long as the session object still exists on the
server. (An earlier timeout or server crash may have destroyed the
session object.)A [#50561028_marker-1673497]##handle is not a
capability, in the [#50561028_marker-1673498]##security sense, that
would automatically grant its holder the right to invoke methods on the
object. When a reference to a session object is obtained from a handle,
and then a method on the session object is invoked, the container
performs the usual access checks based on the caller’s principal.

fields contain _conversational state_ [#50561028_marker-1492077]## on

conversation represented by a specific client/session object pair.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200389]##It typically reads and updates data in a
database on behalf of the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200390]##In the case of a stateful session bean, its
lifetime is controlled by the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1309184]##A container may also terminate a session bean
instance’s life after a Deployer-specified timeout or as a result of the
failure of the server on which the bean instance is running. For this
reason, a client should be prepared to recreate a new session object if
it loses the one it is using.

[#50561028_pgfId-1309185]##Typically, a session object’s conversational
state is not written to the database. A session Bean Provider simply
stores it in the session bean instance’s fields and assumes its value is
retained for the lifetime of the instance. A developer may use an
extended persistence context to store a stateful session bean’s
persistent conversational state. See the document “ _Java Persistence
API”_ specification link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29642[See Java™ Persistence

[#50561028_pgfId-1673540]##A session bean that does not make use of the
Java Persistence API must explicitly manage
[#50561028_marker-1673539]##cached database data. A session bean
instance must write any cached database updates prior to a transaction
completion, and it must refresh its copy of any potentially stale
database data at the beginning of the next transaction. A session bean
must also refresh any _java.sql_ Statement objects before they are used
in a new transaction context. Use of the Java Persistence API provides a
session bean with automatic management of database data, including the
automatic flushing of cached database updates upon transaction commit.

_ejbActivate_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1600174]##The _setSessionContext_
[#50561028_marker-1600173]## method is called by the bean’s container to
associate a session bean instance with its context maintained by the
container. Typically a session bean instance retains its session context
as part of its state.

[#50561028_pgfId-1600206]##The _ejbRemove_ notification signals that the
instance is in the process of being removed by the container. In the
_ejbRemove_ [#50561028_marker-1600205]## method, the instance typically
releases the same resources that it releases in the _ejbPassivate_
[#50561028_marker-1600207]## method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1600177]##Under the EJB 3.x API, the bean class may
optionally define a _PreDestroy_ lifecycle callback interceptor method
for notification of the container’s removal of the bean instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200425]##The _ejbPassivate_ notification signals the
intent of the container to passivate the instance. The _ejbActivate_
notification signals the instance it has just been reactivated. Their
purpose is to allow stateful session beans to maintain those open
resources that need to be closed prior to an instance’s passivation and
then reopened during an instance’s activation. The _ejbPassivate_ and
_ejbActivate_ methods are only called on stateful session bean
instances.

[#50561028_pgfId-1600216]##Under the EJB 3.x API, the bean class may
optionally define _PrePassivate_ and/or _PostActivate_ lifecycle

[#50561028_pgfId-1693962]##[#50561028_marker-1693960]##A stateful
session bean class can optionally implement the javax.ejb.
_SessionSynchronization_ interface or annotate methods using the
individual AfterBegin, BeforeCompletion, and AfterCompletion
annotations. The deployment descriptor may also be used to declare the
individual session synchronization methods. These provide the session
bean instances with [#50561028_marker-1693963]##transaction
synchronization notifications. The instances can use these
notifications, for example, to manage database data they may cache
within transactions—e.g., if the Java Persistence API is not used. A
stateful session bean class may use either the
javax.ejb.SessionSynchronization interface or the session
synchronization annotations, but not both. If annotation are used, there
must be at most one _AfterBegin_ method, one _BeforeCompletion_ method,
and one _AfterCompletion_ method for the bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1492094]##The _afterBegin_ [#50561028_marker-1492097]##
notification signals a session bean instance that a new transaction has
begun. The container invokes this method before the first business
method within a transaction (which is not necessarily at the beginning
of the transaction). The _afterBegin_ notification is invoked with the
transaction context. The instance may do any database work it requires
within the scope of the transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200445]##The _beforeCompletion_
[#50561028_marker-1492098]## notification is issued when a session bean
instance’s client has completed work on its current transaction but
prior to committing the resource managers used by the instance. At this
time, the instance should write out any database updates it has cached.
The instance can cause the transaction to roll back by invoking the
[#50561028_marker-1492099]##setRollbackOnly method on its
_SessionContext_ object.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200446]##The _afterCompletion_
[#50561028_marker-1492100]## notification signals that the current
transaction has completed. A completion status of _true_ indicates that
the transaction has committed. A status of _false_ indicates that a
rollback has occurred. Since a session bean instance’s conversational
state is not transactional, it may need to manually reset its state if a
rollback occurred.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210733]##All Container Providers must support the __
[#50561028_marker-1492101]##session synchronization notifications. If a
bean class implements the _SessionSynchronization_ interface, the
container must invoke the _afterBegin_ , _beforeCompletion_ , and
_afterCompletion_ notifications as required by the specification. If the
bean implementor uses the session synchronization annotations, the
container must invoke only the notifications corresponding to the
annotations that have been used.

[#50561028_pgfId-1697050]##If a stateful session bean's PostConstruct,
PreDestroy, PrePassivate or PostActivate lifecycle callback interceptor
method is invoked in the scope of a transaction, session synchronization
callbacks for the transaction are not called on the bean instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210790]##There is no need for a session bean with

timeout callback method when a timer for the bean has expired. See

[#50561028_pgfId-1200452]##Except as noted below, the container creates
an instance of a session bean as follows. First, the container calls the
bean class constructor to create a new session bean instance. Second,
the container performs any dependency injection as specified by metadata
annotations on the bean class or by the deployment descriptor. This
includes the bean’s SessionContext, if applicable. Third, the container
calls the _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor methods for the

signature matches the signature of the _create<METHOD>_ invoked by the
client, passing to the method the input parameters sent from the client.
If the bean class is written to the EJB 3.x API, and has been adapted
for use with an earlier client view, this initialization method is a
matching _Init_ method, as designated by use of the _Init_ annotation,

[#50561028_pgfId-1200454]##Each stateful session bean class that has a
home interface must have at least one such initialization method. The
number and signatures of a session bean’s initialization methods are

it is not required that a stateless session bean have an _ejbCreate_
method, even when it has a home interface. An EJB 3.x stateless session
bean class may have a _PostConstruct_ method, as described in Section

concurrency requirements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643517]##The container serializes calls to each
stateful and stateless session bean instance. Most containers will
support many instances of a session bean executing concurrently;
however, each instance sees only a serialized sequence of method calls.
Therefore, a stateful or stateless session bean does not have to be
coded as reentrant.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210776]##The container must serialize all the
[#50561028_marker-1492104]##container-invoked callbacks (that is, the
business method interceptor methods, lifecycle callback interceptor
methods, timeout callback methods, beforeCompletion methods, and so on),
and it must serialize these callbacks with the client-invoked business
method calls.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659677]##By default, clients are allowed to make
concurrent calls to a stateful session object and the container is
required to serialize such concurrent requests. Note that the container
never permits multi-threaded access to the actual stateful session bean
instance. For this reason, Read/Write method locking metadata, as well
as the bean-managed concurrency mode, are not applicable to stateful
session beans and must not be usedlink:#pgfId-1709265[18]. See

[#50561028_pgfId-1659678]##The Bean Provider may optionally specify that
concurrent client requests to a stateful session bean are prohibited.
This is done using the AccessTimeout annotation or the _access-timeout_
deployment descriptor element with a value of 0. In this case, if a
client-invoked business method is in progress on an instance when
another client-invoked call, from the same or different client, arrives
at the same stateful session bean istance, if the second client is a
client of the bean’s business interface or no-interface view, the
concurrent invocation must result in the second client receiving the
_javax.ejb.ConcurrentAccessExceptionlink:#pgfId-1659681[19]_ . If the
EJB 2.1 client view is used, the container must throw the
java.rmi.RemoteException if the second client is a remote client, or the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ if the second client is a local client.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1644886]##[#50561028_58895]##Asynchronous Methods

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1644897]##A session bean can expose methods with
asynchronous client invocation semantics. For asynchronous invocations,
control returns to the client before the container dispatches the
invocation to a bean instance. An asynchronous method is a business
method exposed through one or more of the remote business, local
business, or no-interface session bean views.

[#50561028_pgfId-1644938]##Asynchronous methods can return a Future<V>
object that allows the client to retrieve a result value, check for
exceptions, or attempt to cancel an in-progress invocation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1644947]##Metadata

[#50561028_pgfId-1664411]##The Asynchronous annotation is used to
designate which business methods are asynchronous.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664412]##The Asynchronous annotation can be applied to
a particular business method of a bean class (or superclass), or to the
bean class (or superclass). If the Asynchronous annotation is applied at
the class level, all business methods declared on that specific class
are asynchronous.

[#50561028_pgfId-1646103]##Asynchronous methods can also be designated
via the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659318]##Asynchronous method invocation semantics only
apply to the no-interface, local business, and remote business client
views. Support for asynchronous business methods exposed through the
local component, remote component, and web service client views is not
required by this specification, and applications which expose such views
with asynchronous methods will not be portable.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1646093]##Method Requirements

[#50561028_pgfId-1644996]##The valid return type of an asynchronous
method is either void or java.util.concurrent.Future<V>, where V is the
result value type.

[#50561028_pgfId-1703077]##An asynchronous method with return type void
must not declare any application exceptions. An asynchronous method with
return type Future<V> is permitted to declare application exceptions.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1703078]##Return Values

[#50561028_pgfId-1703079]##The Bean Provider makes the result value of
an asynchronous invocation available to the client by returning a
Future<V> object for which both get() methods return the result value. A
concrete Future<V> implemention called javax.ejb.AsyncResult<V> is
provided by the container as a convenience. The AsyncResult<V> class has
a constructor that takes the result value as a parameter.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645359]##Example:

[#50561028_pgfId-1645314]##@Asynchronous

[#50561028_pgfId-1645400]##public Future<Integer>
performCalculation(...) \{

[#50561028_pgfId-1645318]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1645319]## // ... do calculation

[#50561028_pgfId-1645320]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1645321]## Integer result = ...;

[#50561028_pgfId-1645322]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1645323]## return new AsyncResult<Integer>(result);

[#50561028_pgfId-1645324]##}

[#50561028_pgfId-1703090]##Note that the Future<V> object returned from
the bean class method (including any instance of AsyncResult<V>) is only
used as a way to pass the result value to the container. This object is
not given directly to the caller, since by definition the caller already
has a container-generated Future<V> object that was returned from the
original invocation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1703091]##Method cancellation

[#50561028_pgfId-1703092]##A client can request that an asynchronous
invocation be cancelled by calling the Future<V>.cancel(boolean
mayInterruptIfRunning) method. The Bean Provider can check whether the
client has requested cancellation by calling the
SessionContext.wasCancelCalled() method within the context of the
asynchronous method. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_69254[See Asynchronous
Invocations] for the description of the client Future contract.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1644968]##Transactions

[#50561028_pgfId-1644972]##The client’s transaction context does not
propagate with an asynchronous method invocation. From the Bean
Provider’s point of view, there is never a transaction context flowing
in from the client. This means, for example, that the semantics of the
REQUIRED transaction attribute on an asynchronous method are exactly the
same as REQUIRES_NEW.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1644973]##Security

[#50561028_pgfId-1644977]##The caller security principal propagates with
an asynchronous method invocation. Caller security principal propagation
behaves exactly the same for asynchronous method invocations as it does
for synchronous session bean invocations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1644978]##Client Exception Behavior

[#50561028_pgfId-1644982]##Client exception behavior depends on whether
the asynchronous method has return type void or Future<V>.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645267]##If the asynchronous method has return type
void, then once control has returned from the client’s method call no
exceptions occurring during the processing of the invocation will be
delivered to the client. For this reason, asynchronous methods with
return type void must not declare application exceptions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645283]##If the asynchronous method has return type
Future<V>, an exception thrown from the processing of the asynchronous
method invocation is accessible to the client via the getCause() method
of a java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException thrown from either
Future.get() method.

image:Ejb-10.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1200537]##[#50561028_marker-1318581]##The following
steps describe the life cycle of a stateful session bean instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1719638]##A session bean instance’s life starts when a
client obtains a reference to a stateful session bean instance through
dependency injection or JNDI lookup, or when the client invokes a
_create<METHOD>_ method on the session bean’s home interface. This
causes the container to invoke the session bean class constructor to
create a new session bean instancelink:#pgfId-1719643[21]. Next, the
container performs any dependency injection as specified by metadata
annotations on the bean class or by the deployment descriptor. The
container then calls the _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor
method(s) for the bean, if any. Finally, if the session bean was written
to the EJB 2.1 client view, the container invokes the matching
_ejbCreate<METHOD>_ or _Init_ method on the instance. The container then
returns the session object reference to the client. The instance is now
in the method ready state.

[#50561028_pgfId-1609011]## _NOTE: When a stateful session bean is
looked up or otherwise obtained through the explicit JNDI lookup
mechanisms, the container must provide a new stateful session bean
instance, as required by the Java EE specification (Section “Java Naming
and Directory Interface (JNDI) Naming Context”
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_61557[See Java™ Naming and Directory Interface 1.2
Specification (JNDI).
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jndi/index.html.])._

[#50561028_pgfId-1200539]##The session bean instance is now ready for
client’s business methods. Based on the transaction attributes in the
session bean’s metadata annotations and/or deployment descriptor and the
transaction context associated with the client’s invocation, a business
method is executed either in a transaction context or with an
unspecified transaction context (shown as “tx method” and “non-tx
method” in the diagram). See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_33330[See Support for
Transactions] for how the container deals with transactions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200543]##A non-transactional method is executed while
the instance is in the [#50561028_marker-1492106]##method ready state.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200544]##An invocation of a transactional method
causes the instance to be included in a transaction. When the session
bean instance is included in a transaction, the container issues the
_afterBegin_ method on it if the session bean has an _afterBegin_
callback methodlink:#pgfId-1703614[22]. The _afterBegin_ method is
invoked on the instance before any business method or business method
interceptor method is executed as part of the transaction. The instance
becomes associated with the transaction and will remain associated with
the transaction until the transaction completes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200545]##Session bean methods invoked by the client in
this transaction can now be delegated to the bean instance. An error
occurs if a client attempts to invoke a method on the session object and
the bean’s metadata annotations and/or deployment descriptor for the
method requires that the container invoke the method in a different
transaction context than the one with which the instance is currently
associated or in an unspecified transaction context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1703625]##If a transaction commit has been requested,
the transaction service notifies the container of the commit request
before actually committing the transaction, and the container issues the
_befor_ _eCompletion_ callback on the instance if the session bean has a
_beforeCompletion_ callback methodlink:Ejb.htm#50561028_79666[See If a
stateful session bean lifecycle callback interceptor method is invoked
in the scope of a transaction, session synchronization callbacks for
such transactions are not called on the bean instance — see section
8.6.2.1.]. When _beforeCompletion_ is invoked, the instance should write
any cached updates to the databaselink:#pgfId-1703628[23]. If a
transaction rollback had been requested instead, the rollback status is
reached without the container issuing a _beforeCompletion_ . The
container may not call the _beforeCompletion_ method if the transaction
has been marked for rollback (nor does the instance write any cached
updates to the database).

[#50561028_pgfId-1200547]##The transaction service then attempts to
commit the transaction, resulting in either a commit or rollback.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200548]##When the transaction completes, the container
issues _afterCompletion_ on the instance if the session bean has an
_afterCompletion_ callback methodlink:Ejb.htm#50561028_79666[See If a
stateful session bean lifecycle callback interceptor method is invoked
in the scope of a transaction, session synchronization callbacks for
such transactions are not called on the bean instance — see section
8.6.2.1.], specifying the status of the completion (either commit or
rollback). If a rollback occurred, the bean instance may need to reset
its conversational state back to the value it had at the beginning of
the transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200549]##The container’s caching algorithm may decide
that the bean instance should be evicted from memory. (This could be
done at the end of each method, or by using an LRU policy). The
container invokes the _PrePassivate_ lifecycle callback interceptor
method(s) for the bean instance, if any. After this completes, the
container saves the instance’s state to secondary storage. A session
bean can be passivated only between transactions, and not within a
transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1290049]##While the instance is in the
[#50561028_marker-1492108]##passivated state, the container may remove
the session object after the expiration of a
[#50561028_marker-1492107]##timeout specified by the Deployer. All
object references and handles for the session object become invalid. If
a client attempts to invoke a method on the bean’s business interface,
the container will throw the
_javax.ejb.NoSuchEJBExceptionlink:#pgfId-1613345[24]_ . If the EJB 2.1
client view is used, the container will throw the
java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException if the client is a remote client, or the
_javax.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException_ if the client is a local client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200550]##If a client invokes a session object whose
session bean instance has been passivated, the container will activate
the instance. To activate the session bean instance, the container
restores the instance’s state from secondary storage and invokes the
_PostActivate_ method for the instance, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200551]##The session bean instance is again ready for
client methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1704487]##When the client calls a business method of
the bean that has been designated as a _Remove_ method on the bean class
or a _remove_ method on the home or component interface, the container
invokes _PreDestroy_ lifecycle callback interceptor methods, if any, for
the bean instance after the _Remove_ method
completes.link:#pgfId-1704448[25] This ends the life of the session bean
instance and the associated session object. If a client subsequently
attempts to invoke a method on the bean’s business interface, the
container will throw the
_javax.ejb.NoSuchEJBExceptionlink:#pgfId-1704451[26]_ . If the EJB 2.1
client view is used, any subsequent attempt causes the
_java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ to be thrown if the client is a remote
client, or the _javax.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException_ if the client is a
local client. (The _java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ is a subclass of the
_java.rmi.RemoteException_ ; the _javax.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException_
is a subclass of the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ ). If the _Remove_ method
completes successfully or if the _Remove_ method throws an application
exception for which _retainIfException_ is not _true_ or if a system
exception is thrown, session synchronization methods are not called on
the bean instance. If an application exception is thrown for which
_retainIfException_ is _true_ , the bean is neither destroyed nor
discarded, and session synchronization methods, if any, are called on
the instance at the end of transaction _._ A container can also invoke
the _PreDestroy_ method on the instance without a client call to remove
the session object:

[#50561028_pgfId-1726644]##After the lifetime of the EJB object has
expired

[#50561028_pgfId-1726645]##When the CDI context, to which the EJB object
belongs to, is destroyed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1726646]##The container must call the afterBegin,
beforeCompletion, and afterCompletion methods if the session bean class
implements, directly or indirectly, the SessionSynchronization
interface, or if the bean class uses the session synchronization
annotations.

Callback methods are permitted to have public access type. This raises
the question of whether a callback method can also be exposed as a
business method through one or more client views. Doing so is not
prohibited, but should be done with caution. The runtime context (e.g.
transaction context, caller principal, operations allowed, etc.) for a
method invoked as a callback can differ significantly from the context
for the same method when invoked via a client invocation. As a general
rule, callback methods should not be exposed as business methods.
Therefore, it is recommended that all non-business methods be assigned
an access type other than public.]).

[#50561028_marker-1492109]##RuntimeException that is not an application
exception thrown from any method of the stateful session bean class
(including the business methods and the lifecycle callback interceptor
methods invoked by the container) results in the transition to the “does
not exist” state. Exception handling is described in detail in Chapter
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13750[See Exception Handling]. See the
_Interceptors_ specification link:Ejb.htm#50561028_21635[See

_javax.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException_ if the client is a local client.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1291848]##Missed PreDestroy Calls

[#50561028_pgfId-1291866]##[#50561028_marker-1318588]##The Bean Provider
cannot assume that the container will always invoke the PreDestroy
lifecycle callback interceptor method(s) (or _ejbRemove_ method) for a
stateful session bean instance. The following scenarios result in the
PreDestroy lifecycle callback interceptor method(s) not being called for
an instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1291879]##A crash of the
[#50561028_marker-1492112]##EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1291883]##A [#50561028_marker-1492111]##system

client inactivity while the instance is in the passive state. The
timeout is specified by the Deployer in an EJB container
implementation-specific way.

[#50561028_pgfId-1291887]##If resources are allocated in a
_PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor method (or
ejbCreate<METHOD> method) and/or in the business methods, and normally
released in a PreDestroy lifecycle callback interceptor method, these
resources will not be automatically released in the above scenarios. The
application using the stateful session bean should provide some clean up
mechanism to periodically clean up the unreleased resources.

[#50561028_pgfId-1291925]##For example, if a shopping cart component is
implemented as a session bean, and the session bean stores the shopping
cart content in a database, the application should provide a program
that runs periodically and removes “abandoned” shopping carts from the
database.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1697701]##[#50561028_58281]##Disabling Passivation of Stateful Session Beans

[#50561028_pgfId-1727559]##By default, the container may passivate a
stateful session bean instance to a secondary storage to save resources.
However, the Bean Provider can optionally configure the stateful session
bean to prevent passivation of its instances.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727631]##For example, a stateful session bean instance
may contain non-serializable attributes which would lead to runtime
exceptions during passivation, or passivation and activation of such
instances may cause degradation of application performance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1697783]##If the passivationCapable element of the
Stateful annotation is set to false or the passivation-capable element
of the session deployment descriptor element is set to false, the
container must not attempt to passivate instances of the bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727604]##Note: application server vendors may use
passivation as a technique to provide high availability of stateful
session beans by replicating their state from one JVM instance to
another across which the container is distributed. In a failure
situation, a stateful session bean is made available on a new JVM
instance by what is commonly called stateful session bean failover. If a
container implementation supports failover of stateful session beans
using bean passivation, the failover capability for not passivation
capable stateful session beans is not defined.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1697784]##Transaction Semantics of Initialization, Destruction, Activation and Passivation

[#50561028_pgfId-1697082]##By default a stateful session bean’s
_PostConstruct_ , _PreDestroy_ , _PrePassivate_ and _PostActivate_
methods are executed in an unspecified transactional context. A
_PostConstruct_ , _PreDestroy_ , _PrePassivate_ and _PostActivate_
method of a stateful session bean with container-managed transaction
demarcation is permitted to have transaction attribute REQUIRES_NEW or
NOT_SUPPORTED (RequiresNew or NotSupported if the deployment descriptor
is used to specify the transaction attribute).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1692465]##Restrictions for Transactions

[#50561028_pgfId-1200554]##[#50561028_marker-1318589]##The state diagram
implies the following restrictions on transaction scoping of the client
invoked business methods. The restrictions are enforced by the container
and must be observed by the client programmer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200555]##A stateful session bean instance can
participate in at most a single transaction at a time.

[#50561028_pgfId-1607229]##If a stateful session bean instance is
participating in a transaction, it is an error for a client to invoke a
method on the session object such that the transaction attribute
specified in the bean’s metadata annotations and/or the deployment
descriptor would cause the container to execute the method in a
different transaction context or in an unspecified transaction context.
In such a case, the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ will be thrown to a client
of the bean’s business interfacelink:#pgfId-1613385[29]. If the EJB 2.1
client view is used, the container throws the _java.rmi.RemoteException_
to the client if the client is a remote client, or the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ if the client is a local client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1607231]##If a stateful session bean instance is
participating in a transaction, it is an error for a client to invoke
the _remove_ method on the session object’s home or component interface
object. The container must detect such an attempt and throw the
_javax.ejb.RemoveException_ to the client. The container should not mark
the client’s transaction for rollback, thus allowing the client to
recover. Note that this restriction only applies to the remove method on
the session object’s home or component interface, not to the invocation
of Remove methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200819]##[#50561028_marker-1318641]##Stateless session
beans are session beans whose instances have no conversational state.
This means that all bean instances are equivalent when they are not
involved in servicing a client-invoked method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1211666]##The term “stateless” signifies that an
instance has no state for a specific client. However, the instance
variables of the instance can contain the state across client-invoked
method calls. Examples of such state include an open database connection
and an object reference to an enterprise bean object.

[#50561028_pgfId-1589189]##The Bean Provider must exercise caution if
retaining any application state across method calls. In particular,
references to bean instance variables should not be returned through
multiple local interface method calls.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200821]##Because all instances of a stateless session
bean are equivalent, the container can choose to delegate a
client-invoked method to any available instance. This means, for
example, that the container may delegate the requests from the same
client within the same transaction to different instances, and that the
container may interleave requests from multiple transactions to the same
instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200822]##[#50561028_marker-1318657]##A container only
needs to retain the number of instances required to service the current
client load. Due to client “think time,” this number is typically much
smaller than the number of active clients. Passivation is not needed or
used for stateless session beans. The container creates another
stateless session bean instance if one is needed to handle an increase
in client work load. If a stateless session bean is not needed to handle
the current client work load, the container can destroy it.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200823]##Because stateless session beans minimize the
resources needed to support a large population of clients, depending on
the implementation of the container, applications that use stateless
session beans may scale somewhat better than those using stateful
session beans. However, this benefit may be offset by the increased
complexity of the client application that uses the stateless beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1600912]##There is no fixed mapping between clients and
stateless instances. The container simply delegates a client’s work to
any available instance that is method-ready.

[#50561028_pgfId-1674167]##[#50561028_marker-1674166]##Local and remote
clients using the EJB 2.1 client view interfaces use the create and
remove methods on the home interface of a stateless session bean in the
same way as on a stateful session bean. To the EJB 2.1 client, it
appears as if the client controls the life cycle of the session object.
However, the container handles the create and remove calls without
necessarily creating and removing an EJB instance.
[#50561028_marker-1674168]##The home interface of a stateless session
bean must have one create method that takes no arguments. The _create_
method of the remote home interface must return the session bean’s
remote interface. The _create_ method of the local home interface must
return the session bean’s local interface.
[#50561028_marker-1674169]##There can be no other _create_ methods in
the home interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200826]##A stateless session bean must not implement
the javax.ejb.SessionSynchronization interface or use the session
synchronization annotations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200864]##The following steps describe the life cycle
of a stateless session bean instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1200865]##A stateless session bean instance’s life
starts when the container invokes the session bean class constructor to
create a new session bean instancelink:#pgfId-1719722[30]. Next, the
container performs any dependency injection as specified by metadata
annotations on the bean class or by the deployment descriptor. The
container then calls the _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor
methods for the bean, if any. The container can perform the instance
creation at any time—there is no direct relationship to a client’s
invocation of a business method or the _create_ method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200866]##The session bean instance is now ready to be
delegated a business method call from any client or a call from the
container to a timeout callback method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1200867]##When the container no longer needs the
instance (usually when the container wants to reduce the number of
instances in the method-ready pool), the container invokes the
_PreDestroy_ lifecycle callback interceptor methods for it, if any. This
ends the life of the stateless session bean instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642783]##A singleton session bean is a session bean
component that is instantiated once per application. In cases where the

will have one bean instance of the singleton for each JVM.

instance lives for the duration of the application in which it is
created. It maintains its state between client invocations but its state
is not required to survive container shutdown or crash.

Life Cycle of a Singleton Session Bean

image:Ejb-12.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1642843]##The following steps describe the life cycle
of a singleton session bean instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1642792]##A singleton session bean instance’s life
starts when the container invokes the session bean class constructor to
create the singleton bean instancelink:#pgfId-1719738[32]. Next, the
container performs any dependency injection as specified by the metadata
annotations on the bean class or by the deployment descriptor. The
container then calls the _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor
methods for the bean, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642861]##The singleton bean instance is now ready to
be delegated a business method call from any client or a call from the
container to a timeout callback method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642853]##When the application is shutting down, the
container invokes the _PreDestroy_ lifecycle callback interceptor
methods on the singleton session bean instance, if any. This ends the
life of the singleton session bean instance.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1642862]##Singleton Session Bean Initialization

[#50561028_pgfId-1642866]##By default, the container is responsible for
deciding when to initialize a singleton session bean instance. However,
the Bean Provider can optionally configure the singleton session bean
for eager initialization. If the Startup annotation appears on the
singleton session bean class or if the singleton session bean has been
designated via the deployment descriptor as requiring eager
initialization, the container must initialize the singleton session bean
instance during the application startup sequence. The container must
initialize all such startup-time singleton session beans before any
external client requests (that is, client requests originating outside
of the application) are delivered to any enterprise bean components in
the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645546]##The following example shows a singleton
session bean with startup logic that initializes its shared state:

[#50561028_pgfId-1645547]##@Startup

[#50561028_pgfId-1645552]##@Singleton

[#50561028_pgfId-1645551]##public class SharedBean implements Shared \{

[#50561028_pgfId-1645553]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1645559]## private SharedData state;

[#50561028_pgfId-1645560]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1645555]## @PostConstruct

[#50561028_pgfId-1645556]## void init() \{

[#50561028_pgfId-1645557]## // initialize shared data

[#50561028_pgfId-1645564]## ...

[#50561028_pgfId-1645558]## }

[#50561028_pgfId-1645563]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1645562]## ...

[#50561028_pgfId-1645554]##}

[#50561028_pgfId-1650693]##In some cases, explicit initialization
ordering dependencies exist between multiple singleton session bean
components in an application. The DependsOn annotation is used to
express these dependencies. A DependsOn dependency is used in cases
where one singleton session bean must initialize before one or more
other singleton session beans. The container ensures that all singleton
session beans with which a singleton session bean has a DependsOn
relationship have been initialized before the PostConstruct method is
called.

[#50561028_pgfId-1663933]##Note that if one singleton session bean
merely needs to invoke another singleton session bean from its
PostConstruct method, no explicit ordering metadata is required. In that
case, the first singleton session bean would merely use an EJB reference
to invoke the target singleton session bean. In this case, the
acquisition of the EJB reference (either through injection or lookup)
does not necessarily imply the actual creation of the corresponding
singleton session bean instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650694]##The following examples illustrate the use of
DependsOn metadata:

[#50561028_pgfId-1642872]##@Singleton

[#50561028_pgfId-1642884]##public class B \{ ... }

[#50561028_pgfId-1642888]##

[#50561028_pgfId-1642880]##public class A \{ ... }

[#50561028_pgfId-1642881]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1642882]##In the above example, the container must
guarantee that singleton _B_ is initialized before singleton _A_ . The
DependsOn value attribute holds one or more strings, where each
specifies the ejb-name of the target singleton session bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1674334]##In the following example, the container must
guarantee that singletons _B_ and _C_ are initialized before singleton
_A_ . In the case of multiple values, the ordering in which the target
ejb-name values are listed is not preserved at runtime. For example, if
singleton _B_ has an ordering dependency on singleton _C_ , it is
singleton _B_ ’s responsibility to explicitly capture that in its own
metadata.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650196]##Any singleton session bean instance that
successfully completes initialization is removed by the container during
application shutdown. At this time the container must invoke the
PreDestroy lifecycle callback interceptor methods on the singleton

session beans with which a singleton session bean has a DependsOn
relationship are still available during the PreDestroy callback. After
the _PreDestroy_ callback completes, the container ends the life of the

[#50561028_pgfId-1643216]##From the client’s perspective, a singleton
session bean always supports concurrent access. In general, the client
of a singleton session bean does not have to concern itself with whether
other clients might be accessing the singleton session bean at the same
time.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643236]##From the Bean Provider’s perspective, there
are two approaches for controlling singleton session bean concurrency
behavior:

[#50561028_pgfId-1643237]##container-managed concurrency: the container
controls concurrent access to the bean instance based on method-level
locking metadata

[#50561028_pgfId-1643241]##bean-managed concurrency: the container
allows full concurrent bean instance access and defers state
synchronization responsibility to the Bean Provider

[#50561028_pgfId-1643506]##When designing a singleton session bean, the
bean provider must decide whether the bean will use container-managed or
bean-managed concurrency. Typically singleton session beans will be
specified to have container-managed concurrency. This is the default if
no concurrency management type is specified. A singleton session bean
can be designed to use either container-managed concurrency or
bean-managed concurrency but it cannot use both.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645527]##The lifecycle of any interceptor classes
associated with a singleton session bean have the same lifecycle and
concurrency behavior as that of the singleton session bean itself. Each
interceptor class will be instantiated once per singleton session bean
instance. Any state stored in an instance of an interceptor class
associated with a singleton session bean should be considered when
devising the concurrency plan for the bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643547]##It is legal to store Java EE objects that do
not support concurrent access (e.g. references to Java Persistence
entity managers or stateful session beans) within the singleton session
bean instance state. However, it is the responsibility of the Bean
Provider to ensure such objects are not accessed by more than one thread
at a time.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652186]##Independent of the bean’s concurrency
management type, the container must ensure that no concurrent access to
the singleton session bean instance occurs until after the instance has
successfully completed its initialization sequence, including any
PostConstruct lifecycle callback method(s). The container must
temporarily block any singleton session bean access attempts that arrive
while the singleton session bean is still initializing.

[#50561028_pgfId-1701985]##Independent of the bean’s concurrency
management type, the container must ensure that concurrent access to the
SessionContext object is thread-safe.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652393]##Singleton session beans support reentrant
calls, i.e., where an outbound call from a singleton session bean method
results in a loopback call to the singleton session bean on the same
thread. Reentrant singleton session beans should be programmed and used
with caution. Special locking semantics apply to loopback calls on
singleton session beans with container-managed concurrency as described
below.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643235]##With container-managed concurrency, the
container is responsible for controlling concurrent access to the bean
instance based on method-level locking metadata. Each business method or
timeout method is associated with either a read (shared) lock or a write
(exclusive) lock.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643255]##If the container invokes a method associated
with a read lock, any number of other concurrent invocations on methods
with read locks are allowed to access the bean instance simultaneously.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643257]##If the container invokes a method associated
with a write lock, no other concurrent invocations will be allowed to
proceed until the method holding the write lock completes its
processing.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643261]##A concurrent access attempt that is not
allowed to proceed due to locking is blocked until it can make forward
progress. Timeouts can be specified via metadata so that a blocked
request can be rejected if a lock is not acquired within a certain
amount of time. If a singleton session bean invocation is rejected due
to lock timeout the ConcurrentAccessTimeoutException is thrown to the
client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650814]##This specification only mandates the basic
read and write locking semantics outlined above. There are many policy
decisions that a container could make to affect the performance of the
locking scheme for a given application. For example:

singleton session bean is determined by the Bean Provider. The
Application Assembler is not permitted to use the deployment descriptor
to override a bean’s concurrency management type regardless of whether

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1643306]##Specification of the Container-Managed Concurrency Metadata for a Bean’s Methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1643318]##The Bean Provider of a singleton session bean
with container-managed concurrency may specify locking metadata for the
enterprise bean’s methods. By default, the value of the lock associated
with a method of a bean with container managed concurrency is a write
lock (exclusive lock).

[#50561028_pgfId-1643319]##A concurrency locking attribute is a value
associated with each of the following methods:

[#50561028_pgfId-1643320]##a method of a bean’s business interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1643324]##a method of a bean’s no-interface view

[#50561028_pgfId-1643325]##a timeout callback method

[#50561028_pgfId-1651625]##a web service endpoint method

[#50561028_pgfId-1651627]##The concurrency locking attribute specifies
how the container must manage concurrency when a client invokes the
method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643333]##Concurrency locking attributes are specified
for the following methods:

[#50561028_pgfId-1643334]##For a bean written to the EJB 3.x client view
API, the concurrency locking attributes are specified for those methods
of the bean class that correspond to the bean’s business interface, the
direct and indirect superinterfaces of the business interface, methods
exposed through the no-interface view, and for timeout callback methods,
if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643338]##For a bean that provides a web service client
view, the concurrency locking attributes are specified for those methods
of the bean class that correspond to the bean’s web service endpoint
methods, and for timeout callback methods, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1674688]##The following rules apply to the
specification of concurrency attributes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652120]##The Lock(READ) and Lock(WRITE)annotations are
used to specify concurrency locking attributes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643369]##The concurrency locking attributes for the
methods of a bean class may be specified on the class, the business
methods of the class, or both.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643370]##Specifying the Lock annotation on the bean
class means that it applies to all applicable business methods of the
class. If the concurrency locking attribute is not specified, it is
assumed to be Lock(WRITE). The absence of a concurrency attribute
specification on the bean class is equivalent to the specification of
Lock(WRITE)on the bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643371]##A concurrency locking attribute may be
specified on a method of the bean class to override the concurrency
locking attribute value explicitly or implicitly specified on the bean
class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643372]##If the bean class has superclasses, the
following additional rules apply:

[#50561028_pgfId-1643373]##A concurrency locking attribute specified on
a superclass S appplies to the business methods defined by S. If a
class-level concurrency attribute is not specified on S, it is
equivalent to specification of Lock(WRITE)on S.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643377]##A concurrency locking attribute may be
specified on a business method M defined by class S to override for
method M the concurrency locking attribute value explicitly or
implicitly specified on the class S.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643378]##If a method M of class S overrides a business
method defined by a superclass of S, the concurrency locking attribute
of M is determined by the above rules as applied to class S.

[#50561028_pgfId-1674678]##The Bean Provider may use the deployment
descriptor as an alternative to metadata annotations to specify the
concurrency locking attributes. Concurrency locking attributes specified
in the deployment descriptor are assumed to override or supplement
concurrency locking attributes specified in annotations. If a
concurrency locking attribute value is not specified in the deployment
descriptor, it is assumed that the concurrency locking attribute
specified in annotations applies, or — in the case that no annotation
has been specified —that the value is Write.

[#50561028_pgfId-1674679]##The Application Assembler is permitted to
override the concurrency locking attribute values using the bean’s
deployment descriptor. The Deployer is also permitted to override the
concurrency locking attribute values at deployment time. Caution should
be exercised when overriding the concurrency locking attributes of an
application, as the concurrency structure of an application is typically
intrinsic to the semantics of the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643379]##Example:

[#50561028_pgfId-1643386]##@Lock(READ)

[#50561028_pgfId-1643390]##public class SomeClass \{

[#50561028_pgfId-1643391]## public void aMethod () \{ ... }

[#50561028_pgfId-1643392]## public void bMethod () \{ ... }

[#50561028_pgfId-1643393]## ...

[#50561028_pgfId-1643394]##}

[#50561028_pgfId-1643395]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1643396]##@Singleton public class ABean extends
SomeClass implements A \{

[#50561028_pgfId-1643397]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1643398]## public void aMethod () \{ ... }

[#50561028_pgfId-1643399]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1643400]## @Lock(WRITE)

[#50561028_pgfId-1643401]## public void cMethod () \{ ... }

[#50561028_pgfId-1643402]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1643403]## ...

[#50561028_pgfId-1643404]##}

[#50561028_pgfId-1643405]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1643406]##Assuming that aMethod, bMethod, cMethod of
singleton session bean ABean are methods of business interface A, their
concurrency locking attributes are Lock(WRITE), Lock(READ), and
Lock(WRITE)respectively.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1646529]##Concurrent Access Timeouts

[#50561028_pgfId-1646539]##A concurrent access attempt that cannot
immediately acquire the appropriate lock is blocked until it can make
forward progress. The AccessTimeout annotation is used to specify the
amount of time the access attempt should be blocked before timing out.
Access timeouts only apply to methods eligible for concurrency locks on
a singleton session bean with container-managed concurrency. If an
access attempt times out, the container throws the
javax.ejb.ConcurrentAccessTimeoutException to the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1646569]##The AccessTimeout annotation can be specified
on a business method or on a bean class (or superclass). An
AccessTimeout annotation specified on a class applies the access timeout
to all business methods of that class. If the AccessTimeout annotation
is specified on both a class and on a business method of that class, the
method-level annotation takes precedence.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664491]##An _AccessTimeout_ value of -1 indicates that
the client request will block indefinitely until forward progress can be
made.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664492]##An AccessTimeout value of 0 indicates that
concurrent access is not allowed. Access attempts on methods with a
timeout value of 0 result in the javax.ejb.ConcurrentAccessException.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1643217]##Operations Allowed in the Methods of a Singleton Session Bean

[#50561028_pgfId-1201119]##[#50561028_marker-1318684]##This section
describes the responsibilities of the Container Provider to support a
session bean. The Container Provider is responsible for providing the
deployment tools and for managing the session bean instances at runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1210801]##Because the EJB specification does not define
the API between deployment tools and the container, we assume that the
deployment tools are provided by the Container Provider. Alternatively,
the deployment tools may be provided by a different vendor who uses the
container vendor’s specific API.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1201121]##Generation of Implementation Classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1201122]##The deployment tools provided by the
container are responsible for the generation of additional classes when
the session bean is deployed. The tools obtain the information that they
need for generation of the additional classes by introspecting the
classes and interfaces provided by the Bean Provider and by examining
the session bean’s deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1201123]##The [#50561028_marker-1492138]##deployment
tools must generate the following classes:

[#50561028_pgfId-1201124]##A class that implements the session bean’s
business interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642568]##A class that implements the session bean’s
no-interface view.

[#50561028_pgfId-1601154]##A class that implements the session bean’s
remote home interface (session EJBHome class).

[#50561028_pgfId-1201125]##A class that implements the session bean’s
remote component interface (session EJBObject class).

[#50561028_pgfId-1474125]##A class that implements the session bean’s
local home interface (session EJBLocalHome class).

[#50561028_pgfId-1474126]##A class that implements the session bean’s
local component interface (session EJBLocalObject class).

[#50561028_pgfId-1554396]##A class that implements the session bean’s
web service endpoint.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645428]##A class that implements the return value of
an asynchronous method with return type _Future<V>_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1554399]##The [#50561028_marker-1554398]##deployment
tools may also generate a class that mixes some container-specific code
with the session bean class. This code may, for example, help the
container to manage the bean instances at runtime. The tools can use
subclassing, delegation, and code generation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1201127]##The deployment tools may also allow the
generation of additional code that wraps the business methods and is
used to customize the business logic to an existing operational
environment. For example, a wrapper for a debit function on the
AccountManager bean may check that the debited amount does not exceed a
certain limit.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606055]##This chapter specifies the contract between a
message-driven bean and its container. It defines the life cycle of the
message-driven bean instances.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606056]##This chapter defines the developer’s view of
message-driven bean state management and the container’s responsibility
for managing message-driven bean state.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1606057]##Overview

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1606059]##[#50561028_marker-1606058]##A message-driven
bean is an [#50561028_marker-1606060]##asynchronous message consumer. A
message-driven bean is invoked by the container as a result of the
arrival of a message at the destination or endpoint that is serviced by
the message-driven bean. A message-driven bean instance is an instance
of a message-driven bean class. A message-driven bean is defined for a
single messaging type, in accordance with the message listener interface
it employs.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606062]##To a client, a message-driven bean is a
[#50561028_marker-1606061]##message consumer that implements some
business logic running on the server. A client accesses a message-driven
bean by sending messages to the destination or endpoint for which the
message-driven bean class is the message listener.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606063]##Message-driven beans are anonymous. They have
no client-visible identity.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606064]##Message-driven bean instances have no
conversational state. This means that all bean instances are equivalent
when they are not involved in servicing a client message.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606065]##A message-driven bean instance is created by
the container to handle the processing of the messages for which the
message-driven bean is the consumer. Its lifetime is controlled by the
container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606066]##A message-driven bean instance has no state
for a specific client. However, the instance variables of the
message-driven bean instance can contain state across the handling of
client messages. Examples of such state include an open database
connection and a reference to an enterprise bean.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1606067]##Goals

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1606068]##The goal of the message-driven bean model is
to make developing an enterprise bean that is asynchronously invoked to
handle the processing of incoming messages as simple as developing the
same functionality in any other message listener.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606069]##A further goal of the message-driven bean
model is to allow for the concurrent processing of a stream of messages
by means of container-provided pooling of message-driven bean instances.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1606070]##Client View of a Message-Driven Bean

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1606072]##[#50561028_marker-1606071]##To a client, a
message-driven bean is simply a message consumer. The client sends
messages to the destination or endpoint for which the message-driven
bean is the message listener just as it would to any other destination
or endpoint. The message-driven bean, as a message consumer, handles the
processing of the messages.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606074]##[#50561028_marker-1606073]##From the
perspective of the client, the existence of a message-driven bean is
completely hidden behind the destination or endpoint for which the
message-driven bean is the message listener. The following diagram
illustrates the view that is provided to a message-driven bean’s
clients.

in a Container

image:Ejb-13.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1606098]##A client’s JNDI name space may be configured
to include the destinations or endpoints of message-driven beans
installed in multiple EJB containers located on multiple machines on a
network. The actual locations of an enterprise bean and EJB container
are, in general, transparent to the client using the enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606099]##References to message destinations can be
injected, or they can be looked up in the client’s JNDI namespace.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606102]##For example, the reference to the queue for a
JMS message-driven bean might be injected as follows.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606103]##@Resource Queue stockInfoQueue;

[#50561028_pgfId-1606104]##Alternatively, the queue for the _StockInfo_
JMS message-driven bean might be located using the following code
segment:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606105]##Context initialContext = new
InitialContext();

[#50561028_pgfId-1606106]##Queue stockInfoQueue =
(javax.jms.Queue)initialContext.lookup +
(“java:comp/env/jms/stockInfoQueue”);

[#50561028_pgfId-1606108]##The remainder of this chapter describes the
message-driven bean life cycle in detail and the protocol between the
message-driven bean and its container.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1606109]##Protocol Between a Message-Driven Bean Instance and its Container

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1606111]##[#50561028_marker-1606110]##From its creation
until destruction, a message-driven bean instance lives in a container.
The container provides security, concurrency, transactions, and other
services for the message-driven bean. The container manages the life
cycle of the message-driven bean instances, notifying the instances when
bean action may be necessary, and providing a full range of services to
ensure that the message-driven bean implementation is scalable and can
support the concurrent processing of a large number of messages.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606112]##From the Bean Provider’s point of view, a
message-driven bean exists as long as its container does. It is the
container’s responsibility to ensure that the message-driven bean comes
into existence when the container is started up and that instances of
the bean are ready to receive asynchronous message delivery before the
delivery of messages is started.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606113]##Containers themselves make no actual service
demands on the message-driven bean instances. The calls a container
makes on a bean instance provide it with access to container services
and deliver notifications issued by the container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606114]##Since all instances of a message-driven bean
are equivalent, a client message can be delivered to any available
instance.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606116]##Required MessageDrivenBean Metadata

[#50561028_pgfId-1606117]##A message-driven bean must be annotated with
the _MessageDriven_ annotation or denoted in the deployment descriptor
as a message-driven bean. The _MessageDriven_ annotation is a
component-defining annotation and is applied to the bean class.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606119]##The Required Message Listener Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1606120]##The message-driven bean class must implement
the appropriate message listener interface for the messaging type that
the message-driven bean supports or specify the message listener
interface using the _MessageDriven_ metadata annotation or the
_messaging-type_ deployment descriptor element. The specific message
listener interface that is implemented by a message-driven bean class
distinguishes the messaging type that the message-driven bean supports.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606121]##The message-driven bean class’s
implementation of the _javax.jms.MessageListener_ interface
distinguishes the message-driven bean as a JMS message-driven bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606123]##[#50561028_marker-1606122]##The bean’s
message listener method (e.g., _onMessage_ in the case of
_javax.jms.MessageListener_ ) is called by the container when a message
has arrived for the bean to service. The message listener method
contains the business logic that handles the processing of the message.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606124]##A bean’s message listener interface may
define more than one message listener method. If the message listener
interface contains more than one method, it is the resource adapter that
determines which method is invoked. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_30765[See
Java EE™ Connector Architecture, version 1.7 (Connector).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1729499]##If the message-driven bean class implements
more than one interface other than _java.io.Serializable_ ,
_java.io.Externalizable_ , or any of the interfaces defined by the
_javax.ejb_ package, the message listener interface must be specified by
the _messageListenerInterface_ element of the _MessageDriven_ annotation
or the _messaging-type_ element of the _message-driven_ deployment
descriptor element.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1729501]##[#50561028_96091]##Message-Driven Bean with No-Methods Listener Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1729502]##A message-driven bean is permitted to
implement a listener interface with no methods. A bean that implements a
no-methods interface, exposes all non-static public methods of the bean
class and of any superclasses except java.lang.Object as message
listener methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1736240]##In this case, when requested by a resource
adapter, the container provides a proxy which implements the message
listener interface and all message listener methods of the bean. A
resource adapter may use the Reflection API to invoke a message listener
method on such a proxy. When the resource adapter invokes a method on
the proxy, the message listener method on the bean instance and any
interceptor methods are invoked as needed. The resource adapter
determines which message listener method is invoked according to its
implementation logic.

[#50561028_pgfId-1736241]##Only public methods of the bean class and of
any superclasses except java.lang.Object may be invoked by a resource
adapter. Attempted invocations of methods with any other access
modifiers on a proxy provided by the container must result in the
javax.ejb.EJBException.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606129]##Dependency Injection

[#50561028_pgfId-1606130]##A message-driven bean may use dependency
injection mechanisms to acquire references to resources or other objects
in its environment (see link:Ejb.htm#50561028_94450[See Enterprise Bean
Environment]). If a message-driven bean makes use of dependency
injection, the container injects these references after the bean
instance is created, and before any message-listener methods are invoked
on the bean instance. If a dependency on the _MessageDrivenContext_ is
declared, or if the bean class implements the optional
_MessageDrivenBean_ interface (see Section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42761[See The Optional MessageDrivenBean
Interface]), the _MessageDrivenContext_ is also injected at this time.
If dependency injection fails, the bean instance is discarded.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606137]##Under the EJB 3.x API, the bean class may
acquire the _MessageDrivenContext_ interface through dependency
injection without having to implement the _MessageDrivenBean_ interface.
In this case, the _Resource_ annotation (or _resource-env-ref_
deployment descriptor element) is used to denote the bean’s dependency
on the _MessageDrivenContext_ . See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_94450[See
Enterprise Bean Environment].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1607027]##[#50561028_72475]##The MessageDrivenContext Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1607028]##If the bean specifies a dependency on the
_MessageDrivenContext_ interface (or if the bean class implements the
_MessageDrivenBean_ interface), the container must provide the
message-driven bean instance with a _MessageDrivenContext_ . This gives
the message-driven bean instance access to the instance’s context
maintained by the container. The _MessageDrivenContext_ interface has
the following methods:

[#50561028_pgfId-1607030]##[#50561028_marker-1607029]##The
_setRollbackOnly_ method allows the instance to mark the current
transaction such that the only outcome of the transaction is a rollback.
Only instances of a message-driven bean with container-managed
transaction demarcation can use this method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1607032]##[#50561028_marker-1607031]##The
_getRollbackOnly_ method allows the instance to test if the current
transaction has been marked for rollback. Only instances of a

use this method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1607034]##[#50561028_marker-1607033]##The
_getUserTransaction_ method returns the
_javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface that the instance can use

_javax.ejb.TimerService_ interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1607036]##The _getCallerPrincipal_ method returns the
_java.security.Principal_ that is associated with the invocation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624010]## _PreDestroy_

[#50561028_pgfId-1729311]##The PostConstruct and PreDestroy callback
methods may be defined directly on the bean class or on a separate
interceptor classlink:#pgfId-1729314[39]. The AroundConstruct lifecycle
callback interceptor method, if used, must be defined on an interceptor
class (see link:Ejb.htm#50561028_21635[See Interceptors, version 1.2.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.]). See
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_59442[See Lifecycle Callback Interceptor Methods].

[#50561028_pgfId-1624011]##The _PostConstruct_ callback occurs before
the first message listener method invocation on the bean. This is at a
point after which any dependency injection has been performed by the

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606154]##[#50561028_42761]##The Optional MessageDrivenBean Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1606155]##The message-driven bean class is not required
to implement the _javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean_ interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606156]## _The MessageDrivenBean interface was
required by earlier versions of the Enterprise JavaBeans specification.
Under the EJB 3.x API, the functionality previously provided by the
MessageDrivenBean interface is available to the bean class through the
use of dependency injection (of the MessageDrivenContext) and optional
lifecycle callback methods._

[#50561028_pgfId-1606157]##The _MessageDrivenBean_ interface defines two
methods, _setMessageDrivenContext_ and _ejbRemove_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1606159]##The _setMessageDrivenContext_
[#50561028_marker-1606158]## method is called by the bean’s container to
associate a message-driven bean instance with its context maintained by
the container. Typically a message-driven bean instance retains its
message-driven context as part of its state.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606160]##The _ejbRemove_ notification signals that the
instance is in the process of being removed by the container. In the
_ejbRemove_ method, the instance releases the resources that it is
holding.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606161]##Under the EJB 3.x API, the bean class may
optionally define a _PreDestroy_ callback method for notification of the
container’s removal of the bean instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606162]##This specification requires that the
_ejbRemove_ and the _ejbCreate_ methods of a message-driven bean be
treated as the _PreDestroy_ and _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback
methods, respectively. If the message-driven bean implements the
_MessageDrivenBean_ interface, the _PreDestroy_ annotation can only be
applied to the _ejbRemove_ method. Similar requirements apply to use of
deployment descriptor metadata as an alternative to the use of
annotations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606163]##Timeout Callbacks

[#50561028_pgfId-1606164]##A message-driven bean can be registered with
the EJB Timer Service for time-based event notifications. The container
invokes the appropriate bean instance timeout callback method when a
timer for the bean has expired. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_49136[See
Timer Service].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606182]##Message-Driven Bean Creation

[#50561028_pgfId-1606184]##[#50561028_marker-1606183]##Except as noted
below, the container creates an instance of a message-driven bean in
three steps. First, the container calls the bean class constructor to
create a new message-driven bean instance. Second, the container injects
the bean’s _MessageDrivenContext_ , if applicable, and performs any
other dependency injection as specified by metadata annotations on the
bean class or by the deployment descriptor. Third, the container calls
the instance’s _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback methods, if any. See
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_59442[See Lifecycle Callback Interceptor Methods].

[#50561028_pgfId-1719438]##If an interceptor associated with the
message-driven bean declares an _AroundConstruct_ lifecycle callback
interceptor method, the container follows the rules for the
_AroundConstruct interceptors_ defined in the Interceptors specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_21635[See Interceptors, version 1.2.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1606188]##EJB 2.1 required the message-driven bean
class to implement the _ejbCreate_ method. This requirement has been
removed from the EJB 3.x API. If the message-driven bean class
implements the _ejbCreate_ method, the _ejbCreate_ method is treated as
the bean’s _PostConstruct_ method, and the _PostConstruct_ annotation
can only be applied to the _ejbCreate_ method.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606189]##Message Listener Interceptor Methods for Message-Driven Beans

[#50561028_pgfId-1606190]## _AroundInvoke_ interceptor methods are
supported for message-driven beans. These interceptor methods may be
defined on the bean class or on a interceptor class and apply to the
handling of the invocation of the bean’s message listener method(s).

[#50561028_pgfId-1606194]##Interceptors are described in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_86157[See Interceptors].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606195]##Serializing Message-Driven Bean Methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1606197]##[#50561028_marker-1606196]##The container
serializes calls to each message-driven bean instance. Most containers
will support many instances of a message-driven bean executing
concurrently; however, each instance sees only a serialized sequence of
method calls. Therefore, a message-driven bean does not have to be coded
as reentrant.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606198]##The container must serialize all the
container-invoked callbacks (e.g., lifecycle callback interceptor
methods and timeout callback methods), and it must serialize these
callbacks with the message listener method calls.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606199]##Concurrency of Message Processing

[#50561028_pgfId-1606201]##[#50561028_marker-1606200]##A container
allows many instances of a message-driven bean class to be executing
concurrently, thus allowing for the concurrent processing of a stream of
messages. No guarantees are made as to the exact order in which messages
are delivered to the instances of the message-driven bean class,
although the container should attempt to deliver messages in order when
it does not impair the concurrency of message processing. Message-driven
beans should therefore be prepared to handle messages that are out of
sequence: for example, the message to cancel a reservation may be
delivered before the message to make the reservation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606202]##Transaction Context of Message-Driven Bean Methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1606204]##[#50561028_marker-1606203]##A bean’s message
listener and timeout callback methods are invoked in the scope of a
transaction determined by the transaction attribute specified in the
bean’s metadata annotations or deployment descriptor. If the bean is
specified as using container-managed transaction demarcation, either the
_REQUIRED_ or the _NOT_SUPPORTED_ transaction attribute must be used for
the message listener methods, and either the _REQUIRED_ , _REQUIRES_NEW_
, or the _NOT_SUPPORTED_ transaction attribute for timeout callback
methods. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_33330[See Support for Transactions].

[#50561028_pgfId-1606208]##When a message-driven bean using bean-managed
transaction demarcation uses the _javax.transaction.UserTransaction_
interface to demarcate transactions, the message receipt that causes the
bean to be invoked is not part of the transaction. If the message
receipt is to be part of the transaction, container-managed transaction
demarcation with the _REQUIRED_ transaction attribute must be used.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606209]##The _bean constructor_ , the
_setMessageDrivenContext_ method, the message-driven bean’s dependency
injection methods, and lifecycle callback methods are called with an
unspecified transaction context. Refer to Subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_35028[See Handling of Methods that Run with “an
unspecified transaction context”] for how the container executes methods
with an unspecified transaction context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650789]##A caller principal may propagate into a
message-driven bean’s message listener methods. Whether this occurs is a
function of the specific message-listener interface and associated
messaging provider, but is not governed by this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650805]##The Bean Provider can use the RunAs metadata
annotation (or corresponding deployment descriptor element) to define a
run-as identity for the enterprise bean. The run-as identity applies to
the bean’s message listener methods and timeout methods. Run-as identity
behavior is further defined in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50172[See

[#50561028_pgfId-1606225]##[#50561028_marker-1606224]##JMS
message-driven beans should not attempt to use the JMS API for message
acknowledgment. Message acknowledgment is automatically handled by the
container. If the message-driven bean uses container-managed transaction
demarcation, message acknowledgment is handled automatically as a part
of the transaction commit. If bean-managed transaction demarcation is
used, the message receipt cannot be part of the bean-managed
transaction, and, in this case, the receipt is acknowledged by the
container. If bean-managed transaction demarcation is used, the Bean
Provider can indicate whether JMS _AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE_ semantics or
_DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE_ semantics should apply by using the
_activationConfig_ element of the _MessageDriven_ annotation or by using
the _activation-config-property_ deployment descriptor element. The
property name used to specify the acknowledgment mode is
_acknowledgeMode_ . If the _acknowledgeMode_ property is not specified,
JMS _AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE_ semantics are assumed. The value of the
_acknowledgeMode_ property must be either _Auto-acknowledge_ or
_Dups-ok-acknowledge_ for a JMS message-driven bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606227]##The Bean Provider may declare the JMS message
selector to be used in determining which messages a JMS message-driven

[#50561028_pgfId-1606260]##A RuntimeException that is not an application
exception thrown from any method of the message-driven bean class
(including a message listener method and the callbacks invoked by the
container) results in the transition to the “does not exist” state. If a
message-driven bean uses bean-managed transaction demarcation and throws
a _RuntimeException_ , the container should not acknowledge the message.
Exception handling is described in detail in Chapter
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13750[See Exception Handling]. See the
_Interceptors_ specification link:Ejb.htm#50561028_21635[See
Interceptors, version 1.2. http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.] for the
rules pertaining to lifecycle callback interceptor methods when more
than one such method applies to the bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606264]##From the client perspective, the message
consumer continues to exist. If the client continues sending messages to
the destination or endpoint associated with the bean, the container can
delegate the client’s messages to another instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606265]##The message listener methods of some
messaging types may throw application exceptions. An application
exception is propagated by the container to the resource adapter.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606268]##[#50561028_marker-1606267]##The Bean Provider
cannot assume that the container will always invoke the PreDestroy
callback method (or _ejbRemove_ method) for a message-driven bean
instance. The following scenarios result in the PreDestroy callback
method not being called on an instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606269]##A crash of the EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606270]##A system exception thrown from the instance’s

[#50561028_pgfId-1606271]##If the message-driven bean instance allocates
resources in the PostConstruct lifecycle callback method and/or in the
message listener method, and releases normally the resources in the
PreDestroy method, these resources will not be automatically released in
the above scenarios. The application using the message-driven bean
should provide some clean up mechanism to periodically clean up the
unreleased resources.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606272]##Replying to a JMS Message

[#50561028_pgfId-1606274]##In standard JMS usage scenarios, the
messaging mode of a message’s _JMSReplyTo_ [#50561028_marker-1606273]##
destination (Queue or Topic) is the same as the mode of the destination
to which the message has been sent. Although a message-driven bean is
not directly dependent on the mode of the JMS destination from which it
is consuming messages, it may contain code that depends on the mode of
its message’s _JMSReplyTo_ destination. In particular, if a
[#50561028_marker-1606275]##message-driven bean replies to a message,
the mode of the reply’s message producer and the mode of the
_JMSReplyTo_ destination must be the same. In order to implement a
message-driven bean that is independent of _JMSReplyTo_ mode, the Bean
Provider should use _instanceOf_ to test whether a _JMSReplyTo_
destination is a Queue or Topic, and then use a matching message
producer for the reply.

Life Cycle of a Message-Driven Bean.

image:Ejb-14.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1606321]##The following steps describe the life cycle
of a message-driven bean instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606322]##A message-driven bean instance’s life starts
when the container invokes the message-driven bean class constructor to
create a new instancelink:#pgfId-1719799[40]. Next, the container
injects the bean’s _MessageDrivenContext_ object, if applicable, and
performs any other dependency injection as specified by metadata
annotations on the bean class or by the deployment descriptor. The
container then calls the bean’s _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback
methods, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606323]##The message-driven bean instance is now ready
to be delivered a message sent to its associated destination or endpoint
by any client or a call from the container to a timeout callback method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606324]##When the container no longer needs the
instance (which usually happens when the container wants to reduce the
number of instances in the method-ready pool), the container invokes the
_PreDestroy_ lifecycle callback methods for it, if any. This ends the
life of the message-driven bean instance.

for which the container does not have a meaningful transaction context,
and for all message-driven beans with bean-managed transaction
demarcation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606425]##The UserTransaction interface is unavailable
to message-driven beans with container-managed transaction demarcation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1687399]##Invoking _getEJBHome_ or _getEJBLocalHome_ is
disallowed in message-driven bean methods because there are no EJBHome

invoked.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606429]##[#50561028_marker-1606428]##This section
describes the responsibilities of the message-driven Bean Provider to
ensure that a message-driven bean can be deployed in any EJB container.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606430]##Classes and Interfaces

[#50561028_pgfId-1606431]##The message-driven Bean Provider is
responsible for providing the following class files:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606432]##Message-driven bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606434]##Interceptor classes, if any.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606435]##Message-Driven Bean Class

[#50561028_pgfId-1606436]##The following are the requirements for the
message-driven bean class:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606437]##The class must implement, directly or
indirectly, the message listener interface required by the messaging
type that it supports or the methods of the message listener interface.
In the case of JMS, this is the javax.jms.MessageListener interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606438]##The class must be defined as public, must not
be _final_ , and must not be abstract. The class must be a top level
class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606439]##The class must have a public constructor that
takes no arguments. The container uses this constructor to create
instances of the message-driven bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606440]##The class must not define the finalize
method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606441]##Optionally:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606442]##The class may implement, directly or
indirectly, the javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606443]##The class may implement, directly or
indirectly, the _javax.ejb.TimedObject_ interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606444]##The class may implement the ejbCreate method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1719041]##The class may have an additional constructor
annotated with the Inject annotation (see
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_54063[See Relationship to Contexts and Dependency
Injection (CDI) Specification] and the CDI specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_77639[See Contexts and Dependency Injection for
the Java EE Platform 1.1 (CDI specification)
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346.]).

[#50561028_pgfId-1606445]##The message-driven bean class may have
superclasses and/or superinterfaces. If the message-driven bean has
superclasses, the message listener methods, lifecycle callback
interceptor methods, timeout callback methods, the ejbCreate method, and
the methods of the MessageDrivenBean interface may be defined in the
message-driven bean class or in any of its superclasses.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606446]##The message-driven bean class is allowed to
implement other methods (for example, helper methods invoked internally
by the message listener method) in addition to the methods required by
the EJB specification.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1652256]##Message-Driven Bean Superclasses

[#50561028_pgfId-1652262]##A message-driven bean class is permitted to
have superclasses that are themselves message-driven bean classes.
However, there are no special rules that apply to the processing of
annotations or the deployment descriptor for this case. For the purposes
of processing a particular message-driven bean class, all superclass
processing is identical regardless of whether the superclasses are
themselves message-driven bean classes. In this regard, the use of
message-driven bean classes as superclasses merely represents a
convenient use of implementation inheritance, but does not have
component inheritance semantics.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606447]##Message Listener Method

[#50561028_pgfId-1606448]##The message-driven bean class must define the
message listener methods. The signature of a message listener method
must follow these rules:

[#50561028_pgfId-1606449]##The method must be declared as public.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606450]##The method must not be declared as final or
static.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1728807]##Message-Driven Bean with No-Methods Listener Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1728808]##The following additional requirements apply
for a message-driven bean with a no-methods interface:

[#50561028_pgfId-1728813]##All non-static public methods of the bean
class and of any superclasses except java.lang.Object are exposed as
message listener methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1728814]##Note: This includes callback methods. The
Bean Provider should exercise caution when choosing to expose callback
methods as message listener methods. The runtime context (e.g.
transaction context, caller principal, operations allowed, etc.) for a
method invoked as a callback can differ significantly from the context
for the same method when invoked as a message listener. In general,
callback methods should not be exposed as message listener methods.
Therefore, it is recommended that all methods other than message
listener methods be assigned an access type other than public.

[#50561028_pgfId-1728815]##Only private methods of the bean class and
any superclasses except java.lang.Object may be declared final.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1624040]##[#50561028_59442]##Lifecycle Callback Interceptor Methods

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1629322]## _PostConstruct_ and _PreDestroy_
lifecycle callback interceptor methods may be defined for message-driven
beans. If _PrePassivate_ or _PostActivate_ lifecycle callbacks are
defined, they are ignored.link:#pgfId-1629325[41]

[#50561028_pgfId-1624043]##If the _PostConstruct_ lifecycle callback
interceptor method is the _ejbCreate_ method, or if the _PreDestroy_
lifecycle callback interceptor method is the _ejbRemove_ method, these
callback methods must be implemented on the bean class itself (or on its
superclasses). Except for these cases, the method names can be
arbitrary, but must not start with “ejb” to avoid conflicts with the
callback methods defined by the javax.ejb.EnterpriseBean interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624044]##Lifecycle callback interceptor methods may be
defined on the bean class and/or on an interceptor class of the bean.
Rules applying to the definition of lifecycle callback interceptor
methods are defined in Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_46478[See
Interceptors for LifeCycle Event Callbacks] .

message-driven bean. The Container Provider is responsible for providing
the deployment tools, and for managing the message-driven bean instances
at runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606484]##Because the EJB specification does not define
the API between deployment tools and the container, we assume that the
deployment tools are provided by the Container Provider. Alternatively,
the deployment tools may be provided by a different vendor who uses the
container vendor’s specific API.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1606485]##Generation of Implementation Classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1606486]##The deployment tools provided by the
container are responsible for the generation of additional classes when
the message-driven bean is deployed. The tools obtain the information
that they need for generation of the additional classes by introspecting
the classes and interfaces provided by the Enterprise Bean Provider and
by examining the message-driven bean’s deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1606487]##The deployment tools may generate a class
that mixes some container-specific code with the message-driven bean
class. This code may, for example, help the container to manage the bean
instances at runtime. Subclassing, delegation, and code generation can
be used by the tools.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1728822]##Deployment of Message-Driven Beans with No-Methods Listener Interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1728823]##The Container Provider must support the

of interceptors with Enterprise JavaBeans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1658653]##For the use of interceptors with Enterprise
JavaBeans, the interceptor “target class” is the bean class.
Interceptors may be used with session beans and message-driven beans.

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1623468]##The lifecycle of an interceptor instance is
the same as that of the bean instance with which it is associated. In
the case of interceptors associated with stateful session beans, the
interceptor instances are passivated upon bean instance passivation, and
activated when the bean instance is activated. See sections

interceptors associated with stateful session beans may define
PostActivate and PrePassivate callbacks. Both the interceptor instance
and the bean instance are created or activated before any of the

_PreDestroy_ and _PrePassivate_ callbacks are invoked before the
respective destruction or passivation of either the bean instance or

an interceptor class only. All other interceptor methods can be defined
on an interceptor class and/or directly on the bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1623545]##Lifecycle callback interceptor methods are
invoked in an unspecified security context. Lifecycle callback
interceptor methods are invoked in an unspecified transaction context,
except for singleton and stateful session bean PostConstruct and

[#50561028_pgfId-1687455]##The _InvocationContext_ object provides
metadata that enables interceptor methods to control the behavior of the
invocation chain. The _getContextData_ method enables an interceptor to
retrieve or update the data associated with the invocation by another
interceptor, business method, and/or webservices context in the
invocation chain. The contextual data is not sharable across separate
business method invocations or lifecycle callback events. If
interceptors are invoked as a result of the invocation on a web service
endpoint, the map returned by the _getContextData_ method will be the
JAX-WS MessageContext link:Ejb.htm#50561028_59867[See Java™ API for
XML-based Web Service, version 2.2 (JAX-WS).

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1623727]##The deployment descriptor can be used as an
alternative to metadata annotations to specify interceptors and their
binding to enterprise beans or to override the invocation order of
interceptors as specified in annotations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1718653]##Specification of Interceptors

[#50561028_pgfId-1718654]##The _interceptor_ deployment descriptor
element is used to specify the interceptor methods of an interceptor
class. The interceptor methods are specified by using the
_around-invoke_ , _around-timeout_ , _around-construct_ ,
_post-construct_ , _pre-destroy,_ pre-passivate, and post-activate
elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1718655]##At most one method of a given interceptor
class can be designated as an around-invoke method, an around-timeout
method, a lifecycle callback interceptor method, regardless of whether
the deployment descriptor is used to define interceptors or whether some
combination of annotations and deployment descriptor elements is used.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1718658]##Binding of Interceptors to Target Classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1718659]##The _interceptor-binding_ element is used to
specify the binding of interceptor classes to target classes and their
methods. The subelements of the _interceptor-binding_ element are as
follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1718660]##The _target-name_ element must identify the
associated target class or the wildcard value " _*_ " (which is used to
define interceptors that are bound to all target classes).

[#50561028_pgfId-1718661]##The _interceptor-class_ element specifies the
interceptor class. The interceptor class contained in an
_interceptor-class_ element must either be declared in the _interceptor_
deployment descriptor element or appear in at least one _Interceptor_
annotation on a target class. The _interceptor-order_ element is used as
an optional alternative to specify a total ordering over the
interceptors defined for the given level and above.

[#50561028_pgfId-1718662]##The _exclude-default-interceptors_ and
_exclude-class-interceptors_ elements specify that default interceptors
and class interceptors, respectively, are not to be applied to a target
class and/or method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1718663]##The _method-name_ element specifies the
method name for a method-level interceptor; and the optional
_method-params_ elements identify a single method among multiple methods
with an overloaded method name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1729886]##The _method-name_ element may be used to bind
a constructor-level interceptor using the unqualified name of the bean
class as the value; the optional _method-params_ elements identify the
constructor if a bean class has a constructor annotated with the Inject
annotation in addition to a no-arg constructor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1718664]##Default interceptors are bound to all target
classes in a module using the wildcard syntax " _*_ ". In addition,
interceptors may be bound at the level of the target class (class-level
interceptors) or methods of the target class (method-level
interceptors).

[#50561028_pgfId-1718665]##The binding of interceptors to classes is
additive. If interceptors are bound at the class level and/or default
level as well as at the method level, both class-level and/or
default-level as well as method-level interceptors will apply. The
deployment descriptor may be used to augment the interceptors and
interceptor methods defined by means of annotations. When the deployment
descriptor is used to augment the interceptors specified in annotations,
the interceptor methods specified in the deployment descriptor will be
invoked after those specified in annotations, according to the ordering
specified earlier. The _interceptor-order_ deployment descriptor element
may be used to override this ordering.

[#50561028_pgfId-1718666]##The _exclude-default-interceptors_ element
disables default interceptors for the level at which it is specified and
lower. That is, _exclude-default-interceptors_ when applied at the class
level disables the application of default interceptors for all methods
of the class. The _exclude-class-interceptors_ element applied to a
method disables the application of class-level interceptors for the
given method. Explicitly listing an excluded higher-level interceptor at
a lower level causes it to be applied at that level and below.

[#50561028_pgfId-1718667]##It is possible to override the ordering of
interceptors by using the _interceptor-order_ element to specify a total
ordering of interceptors at class level and/or method level. If the
_interceptor-order_ element is used, the ordering specified at the given
level must be a total order over all interceptor classes that have been
defined at that level and above (unless they have been explicitly
excluded by means of one of the _exclude-_ elements described above).

[#50561028_pgfId-1718668]##There are four possible styles of the
_interceptor-binding_ element syntax:

=== [#50561028_pgfId-1679837]##[#50561028_33330]##Support for Transactions

[#50561028_pgfId-1379358]##One of the key features of the Enterprise
JavaBeans™ architecture is support for distributed transactions. The
Enterprise JavaBeans architecture allows an application developer to
write an application that atomically updates data in multiple databases
which may be distributed across multiple sites. The sites may use EJB
servers from different vendors.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1379359]##Overview

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1379360]##This section provides a brief overview of
transactions and illustrates a number of transaction scenarios in EJB.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379361]##Transactions

[#50561028_pgfId-1379362]##Transactions are a proven technique for
simplifying application programming. Transactions free the application
programmer from dealing with the complex issues of failure recovery and
multi-user programming. The transactional system ensures that a unit of
work either fully completes, or the work is fully rolled back.
Furthermore, transactions make it possible for the programmer to design
the application as if it ran in an environment that executes units of
work serially.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379364]##[#50561028_marker-1379363]##Support for
transactions is an essential element of the Enterprise JavaBeans
architecture. The Enterprise Bean Provider and the client application
programmer are not exposed to the complexity of distributed
transactions. The Bean Provider can choose between using programmatic
transaction demarcation in the enterprise bean code (this style is
called bean-managed transaction demarcation) or declarative transaction
demarcation performed automatically by the EJB container (this style is
called container-managed transaction demarcation).

[#50561028_pgfId-1379366]##[#50561028_marker-1379365]##With bean-managed
transaction demarcation, the enterprise bean code demarcates
transactions using the javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface. All
resource manager accesses between the UserTransaction.begin and
UserTransaction.commit calls are part of a transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1623108]##The terms resource and resource manager used
in this chapter refer to the resources declared using the _Resource_
annotation in the enterprise bean class or using the _resource-ref_
element in the enterprise bean’s deployment descriptor. This includes
not only database resources, but also other resources, such as JMS
Connections. These resources are considered to be “managed” by the
container.link:#pgfId-1623130[44] For a discussion about resources used

[#50561028_pgfId-1379371]##[#50561028_marker-1379370]##With
container-managed transaction demarcation, the container demarcates
transactions per instructions provided by the developer in metadata
annotations or in the deployment descriptor. These instructions, called
transaction attributes, tell the container whether it should include the
work performed by an enterprise bean method in a client’s transaction,
run the enterprise bean method in a new transaction started by the
container, or run the method with “no transaction” (Refer to Subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_35028[See Handling of Methods that Run with “an
unspecified transaction context”] for the description of the “no
transaction” case).

[#50561028_pgfId-1379375]##Regardless of whether an enterprise bean uses
bean-managed or container-managed
[#50561028_marker-1503258]##transaction demarcation, the burden of
implementing transaction management is on the EJB Container and Server
Provider. The EJB container and server implement the necessary low-level
transaction protocols, such as the two-phase commit protocol between a
transaction manager and a database system or messaging provider,
transaction context propagation, and distributed two-phase commit.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379376]## _Many applications will consist of one or
several enterprise beans that all use a single resource manager
(typically a relational database management system). The EJB container
can make use of resource manager local transactions as an optimization
technique for enterprise beans for which distributed transactions are
not needed. A resource manager local transaction does not involve
control or coordination by an external transaction manager. The
container’s use of local transactions as an optimization technique for
enterprise beans with either container-managed transaction demarcation
or bean-managed transaction demarcation is not visible to the enterprise
beans. For a discussion of the use of resource manager local
transactions as a container optimization strategy, refer to

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379380]##Transaction Model

[#50561028_pgfId-1595159]##[#50561028_marker-1595157]##The Enterprise
JavaBeans architecture supports flat transactions. A flat transaction
cannot have any child (nested) transactions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1595160]##Note: The decision not to support nested
transactions allows vendors of existing transaction processing and
database management systems to incorporate support for Enterprise
JavaBeans. If these vendors provide support for nested transactions in
the future, Enterprise JavaBeans may be enhanced to take advantage of
nested transactions.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1595161]##Relationship to JTA and JTS

[#50561028_pgfId-1595165]##The Java™ Transaction API (JTA)
[link:Ejb.htm#50561028_76463[See Java™ Transaction API, version 1.2
(JTA). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=907.]] is a specification of the
interfaces between a transaction manager and the other parties involved
in a distributed transaction processing system: the application
programs, the resource managers, and the application server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379390]##[#50561028_marker-1379389]##The Java
Transaction Service (JTS) [link:Ejb.htm#50561028_98224[See Java™
Transaction Service, version 1.0 (JTS).
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jts-spec095-1508547.pdf.]]
API is a Java binding of the CORBA Object Transaction Service (OTS) 1.1
specification. JTS provides transaction interoperability using the
standard IIOP protocol for transaction propagation between servers. The
JTS API is intended for vendors who implement transaction processing
infrastructure for enterprise middleware. For example, an EJB server
vendor may use a JTS implementation as the underlying transaction
manager.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379394]##The EJB architecture does not require the EJB
container to support the JTS interfaces. The EJB architecture requires
that the EJB container support the JTA API defined in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_76463[See Java™ Transaction API, version 1.2
(JTA). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=907.] and the Connector APIs

[#50561028_pgfId-1379396]##This section describes several scenarios that
illustrate the distributed transaction capabilities of the Enterprise
JavaBeans architecture.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379397]##Update of Multiple Databases

[#50561028_pgfId-1379398]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture makes
it possible for an application program to update data in multiple
databases in a single transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379399]##In the following figure, a client invokes the
enterprise bean X. Bean X updates data using two database connections
that the Deployer configured to connect with two different databases, A
and B. Then X calls another enterprise bean, Y. Bean Y updates data in
database C. The EJB server ensures that the updates to databases A, B,
and C are either all committed or all rolled back.

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1379436]##

Updates to Simultaneous Databases

[#50561028_pgfId-1379437]##The application programmer does not have to
do anything to ensure transactional semantics. Behind the scenes, the
EJB server enlists the database connections as part of the transaction.
When the transaction commits, the EJB server and the database systems
perform a two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomic updates across all
three databases.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379438]##Messages Sent or Received Over JMS Sessions and Update of Multiple Databases

[#50561028_pgfId-1379439]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture makes
it possible for an application program to send messages to or receive
messages from one or more [#50561028_marker-1503259]##JMS Destinations
and/or to update data in one or more databases in a single transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379440]##In the following figure, a client invokes the
enterprise bean X. Bean X sends a message to a JMS queue A and updates
data in a database B using connections that the Deployer configured to
connect with a JMS provider and a database. Then X calls another
enterprise bean, Y. Bean Y updates data in database C. The EJB server
ensures that the operations on A, B, and C are either all committed, or
all rolled back.

Message Sent to JMS Queue and Updates to Multiple Databases

image:Ejb-16.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1379480]##The application programmer does not have to
do anything to ensure transactional semantics. The enterprise beans X
and Y perform the message send and database updates using the standard
JMS and JDBC™ APIs. Behind the scenes, the EJB server enlists the
session on the connection to the JMS provider and the database
connections as part of the transaction. When the transaction commits,
the EJB server and the messaging and database systems perform a
two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomic updates across all the three
resources.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379482]##In the following figure, a client sends a
message to the JMS queue A serviced by the message-driven bean X. Bean X
updates data using two database connections that the Deployer configured
to connect with two different databases, B and C. The EJB server ensures
that the dequeuing of the JMS message, its receipt by bean X, and the
updates to databases B and C are either all committed or all rolled
back.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379517]##Update of Databases via Multiple EJB Servers

[#50561028_pgfId-1379518]##The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture allows
updates of data at multiple sites to be performed in a single
transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379519]##In the following figure, a client invokes the
enterprise bean X. Bean X updates data in database A, and then calls
another enterprise bean Y that is installed in a remote EJB server. Bean
Y updates data in database B. The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture
makes it possible to perform the updates to databases A and B in a
single transaction.

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1379552]##

Updates to Multiple Databases in Same Transaction

image:Ejb-18.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1379553]##When X invokes Y, the two EJB servers
cooperate to propagate the transaction context from X to Y. This
transaction context propagation is transparent to the application-level
code.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379554]##At transaction commit time, the two EJB
servers use a distributed two-phase commit protocol (if the capability
exists) to ensure the atomicity of the database updates.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379556]##[#50561028_22489]##Client-Managed Demarcation

[#50561028_pgfId-1379557]##A Java client can use the
[#50561028_marker-1503262]##javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface
to explicitly demarcate transaction boundaries. The client program
obtains the javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface through
dependency injection or lookup in the bean’s EJBContext or in the JNDI
name space.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379562]##A client program using
[#50561028_marker-1503263]##explicit transaction demarcation may
perform, via enterprise beans, atomic updates across multiple databases
residing at multiple EJB servers, as illustrated in the following
figure.

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1379596]##

image:Ejb-5.gif[image]

Updates on Multiple Databases on Multiple Servers

image:Ejb-19.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1379597]##The application programmer demarcates the
transaction with begin and commit calls. If the enterprise beans X and Y
are configured to use a client transaction (i.e., their methods have
transaction attributes that either require or support an existing
transaction context), the EJB server ensures that the updates to
databases A and B are made as part of the client’s transaction.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379598]##Container-Managed Demarcation

[#50561028_pgfId-1729780]##Whenever a client invokes a method on an
enterprise bean’s business interface, on the bean no-interface view, on
a home or component interface, or a message listener method, the
container interposes on the method invocation. The interposition allows
the container to control [#50561028_marker-1729781]##transaction
demarcation declaratively through the transaction attribute set by the
developer. (See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_85553[See Specification of the
Transaction Attributes for a Bean’s Methods] for a description of
transaction attributes.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1379603]##For example, if a session bean method is
configured with the REQUIRED transaction attribute, the container
behaves as follows: If the client request is not associated with a
transaction context, the container automatically initiates a transaction
whenever a client invokes an enterprise bean method that requires a
transaction context. If the client request contains a
[#50561028_marker-1503265]##transaction context, the container includes
the enterprise bean method in the client transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379604]##The following figure illustrates such a
scenario. A non-transactional client invokes the enterprise bean X, and
the invoked method has the _REQUIREDlink:#pgfId-1609533[45]_ transaction
attribute. Because the invocation from the client does not include a
transaction context, the container starts a new transaction before
dispatching the method on X. Bean X’s work is performed in the context
of the transaction. When X calls other enterprise beans (Y in our
example), the work performed by the other enterprise beans is also
automatically included in the transaction (subject to the transaction
attribute of the other enterprise bean).

listener method is configured with the REQUIRED transaction attribute,
the container automatically starts a new transaction before the delivery
of the message and, hence, before the invocation of the
method.link:#pgfId-1559311[46]

[#50561028_pgfId-1554977]##JMS requires that the transaction be started
before the dequeuing of the message. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_98763[See
Java™ Message Service, version 2.0 (JMS).

[#50561028_pgfId-1554975]##The container automatically enlists the
resource manager associated with the arriving message and all the
resource managers accessed by the message listener method with the
transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1731398]##It is illegal to associate JTA transactional
interceptors (see link:Ejb.htm#50561028_76463[See Java™ Transaction API,

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1379723]##Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1379724]##This section describes the Bean Provider’s
view of transactions and defines the Bean Provider’s responsibilities.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379725]##[#50561028_21232]##Bean-Managed Versus Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation

[#50561028_pgfId-1379727]##[#50561028_marker-1379726]##When designing an
enterprise bean, the developer must decide whether the enterprise bean
will demarcate transactions programmatically in the business methods
(bean-managed transaction demarcation), or whether the transaction
demarcation is to be performed by the container based on the transaction
attributes specified in metadata annotations or in the deployment
descriptor (container-managed transaction demarcation). Typically
enterprise beans will be specified to have container-managed transaction
demarcation. This is the default if no transaction management type is
specified.

[#50561028_pgfId-1683893]##[#50561028_marker-1683891]##A session bean or
a message-driven bean can be designed with bean-managed transaction
demarcation or with container-managed transaction demarcation. (But it
cannot be both at the same time.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1683895]##An enterprise bean instance can access
resource managers in a transaction only in the enterprise bean’s methods
in which there is a transaction context available.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1511883]##[#50561028_marker-1511882]##Non-Transactional Execution

[#50561028_pgfId-1379746]##Some enterprise beans may need to access
resource managers that do not support an external transaction
coordinator. The container cannot manage the transactions for such
enterprise beans in the same way that it can for the enterprise beans
that access resource managers that support an external transaction
coordinator.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379747]##If an enterprise bean needs to access a
resource manager that does not support an external transaction
coordinator, the Bean Provider should design the enterprise bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation and assign the NOT_SUPPORTED
transaction attribute to the bean class or to all the bean’s methods.
The EJB architecture does not specify the transactional semantics of the
enterprise bean methods. See Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_35028[See
Handling of Methods that Run with “an unspecified transaction context”]
for how the container implements this case.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1379751]##Isolation Levels

[#50561028_pgfId-1379752]##Transactions not only make completion of a
unit of work atomic, but they also isolate the units of work from each
other, provided that the system allows concurrent execution of multiple
units of work.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379754]##[#50561028_marker-1379753]##The isolation
level describes the degree to which the access to a resource manager by
a transaction is isolated from the access to the resource manager by
other concurrently executing transactions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379755]##The following are guidelines for managing
isolation levels in enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379756]##The API for managing an isolation level is
resource-manager-specific. (Therefore, the EJB architecture does not
define an API for managing isolation levels.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1379757]##If an enterprise bean uses multiple resource
managers, the Bean Provider may specify the same or different isolation
level for each resource manager. This means, for example, that if an
enterprise bean accesses multiple resource managers in a transaction,
access to each resource manager may be associated with a different
isolation level.

[#50561028_pgfId-1379758]##The Bean Provider must take care when setting
an isolation level. Most resource managers require that all accesses to
the resource manager within a transaction are done with the same
isolation level. An attempt to change the isolation level in the middle
of a transaction may cause undesirable behavior, such as an implicit
sync point (a commit of the changes done so far).

[#50561028_pgfId-1683910]##For session beans and message-driven beans
with bean-managed transaction demarcation, the Bean Provider can specify
the desirable isolation level programmatically in the enterprise bean’s
methods, using the resource-manager specific API. For example, the Bean
Provider can use the java.sql.Connection.setTransactionIsolation method
to set the appropriate isolation level for database access.

[#50561028_pgfId-1683911]##Additional care must be taken if multiple
enterprise beans access the same resource manager in the same
transaction. Conflicts in the requested isolation levels must be
avoided.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380068]##[#50561028_marker-1380067]##An enterprise
bean with container-managed transaction demarcation can use the
setRollbackOnly method of its EJBContext object to mark the transaction
such that the transaction can never commit. Typically, an enterprise
bean marks a transaction for rollback to protect data integrity before
throwing an application exception, if the application exception class
has not been specified to automatically cause the container to rollback
the transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380069]##For example, an _AccountTransfer_ bean which
debits one account and credits another account could mark a transaction
for rollback if it successfully performs the debit operation, but
encounters a failure during the credit operation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380072]##[#50561028_marker-1380071]##An enterprise
bean with container-managed transaction demarcation can use the
getRollbackOnly method of its EJBContext object to test if the current
transaction has been marked for rollback. The transaction might have
been marked for rollback by the enterprise bean itself, by other
enterprise beans, or by other components (outside of the EJB
specification scope) of the transaction processing infrastructure.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380073]##Use of JMS APIs in Transactions

[#50561028_pgfId-1381338]##The Bean Provider should not make use of the
JMS request/reply paradigm (sending of a JMS message, followed by the
synchronous receipt of a reply to that message) within a single
[#50561028_marker-1503271]##transaction. Because a
[#50561028_marker-1503270]##JMS message is typically not delivered to
its final destination until the transaction commits, the receipt of the
reply within the same transaction will not take place.

[#50561028_pgfId-1381339]##Because the container manages the
transactional enlistment of JMS sessions on behalf of a bean, the
parameters of the _createSession(boolean_ _transacted,_ _int_
_acknowledgeMode)_ , _createQueueSession(boolean_ _transacted,_ _int_
_acknowledgeMode)_ and _createTopicSession(boolean_ _transacted,_ _int_
_acknowledgeMode)_ methods are ignored. It is recommended that the Bean
Provider specify that a session is transacted, but provide _0_ for the
value of the acknowledgment mode.

[#50561028_pgfId-1381342]##The Bean Provider should not use the JMS
_acknowledge_ method either within a transaction or within an
unspecified transaction context. Message acknowledgment in an
unspecified transaction context is handled by the container.
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_35028[See Handling of Methods that Run with “an
unspecified transaction context”] describes some of the techniques that
the container can use for the implementation of a method invocation with
an unspecified transaction context.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380076]##Specification of a Bean’s Transaction Management Type

[#50561028_pgfId-1380079]##By default, a session bean or message-driven
bean has container managed transaction demarcation if the transaction
management type is not specified. The Bean Provider of a session bean or
a message-driven bean can use the TransactionManagement annotation to
declare whether the session bean or message-driven bean uses
bean-managed or container-managed transaction demarcation. The value of
the _TransactionManagement_ annotation is either _CONTAINER_ or _BEAN_ .
The _TransactionManagement_ annotation is applied to the enterprise bean
class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1608534]##Alternatively, the Bean Provider can use the
_transaction-type_ deployment descriptor element to specify the bean’s
transaction management type. If the deployment descriptor is used, it is
only necessary to explicitly specify the bean’s transaction management
type if bean-managed transaction is used.

[#50561028_pgfId-1609906]##The transaction management type of a bean is
determined by the Bean Provider. The Application Assembler is not
permitted to use the deployment descriptor to override a bean’s
transaction management type regardless of whether it has been explicitly
specified or defaulted by the Bean Provider. (See Chapter
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_84706[See Deployment Descriptor] for information
about the deployment descriptor.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1595768]##The following rules apply for the
specification of transaction attributes in the deployment descriptor.
(See Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_94118[See Deployment Descriptor XML

[#50561028_pgfId-1689658]##The container-transaction element may be used

methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1698655]##stateful session bean PostConstruct,
PreDestroy, PrePassivate or PostActivate methods (see limitations)

[#50561028_pgfId-1698656]##timeout callback methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1698657]##Each container-transaction element consists
of a list of one or more method elements, and the trans-attribute
element. The container-transaction element specifies that all the listed
methods are assigned the specified transaction attribute value. It is
required that all the methods specified in a single
container-transaction element be methods of the same enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380178]##[#50561028_marker-1380177]##The method
element uses the ejb-name, method-intf, method-name, and method-params
elements to denote one or more methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730611]##The optional _method-intf_ element can be
used to differentiate between methods with the same name and signature
that are multiply defined across the business, component, and home
interfaces, web service endpoint, no-interface view, singleton and
stateful session bean lifecycle callbacks, and/or timeout callbacks.
However, if the same method is a method of a local business interface,
local component interface, or no-interface view, the same transaction
attribute applies to the method for all of them. Likewise, if the same
method is a method of both a remote business interface and the remote
component interface, the same transaction attribute applies to the
method for both interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730609]##There are three legal styles of composing the
method element:

[#50561028_pgfId-1698604]## +
<method> +
<ejb-name>EJBNAME</ejb-name> +
<method-name>*</method-name> +
</method> +
 +
This style is used to specify a default value of the transaction
attribute for the following methods, if any, of the specified enterprise
bean for which there is no Style 2 or Style 3 element specified:

[#50561028_pgfId-1730624]##All methods of the business, home, or
component interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1730635]##All no-interface view methods

methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1730646]##All timeout callback methods

[#50561028_pgfId-1698740]##There must be at most one
container-transaction element that uses the Style 1 method element for a
given enterprise bean, unless the method-intf element is used with this
style.

[#50561028_pgfId-1698724]##This style may be used for stateful session
bean lifecycle callback methods to specify their transaction attributes
if used with the method-intf element value LifecycleCallback.

<method> +
<ejb-name>EJBNAME</ejb-name> +
<method-name>METHOD</method-name> +
</method> +
 +
This style is used for referring to a specified method of a business,
home, or component interface method; no-interface view method; message
listener method; web service endpoint method; singleton PostConstruct
and PreDestroy methods; or timeout callback method of the specified
enterprise bean. If there are multiple methods with the same overloaded
name, this style refers to all the methods with the same name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1699006]##There must be at most one
container-transaction element that uses the Style 2 method element for a
given method name, unless the method-intf element is used with this
style. If there is also a container-transaction element that uses Style
1 element for the same bean, the value specified by the Style 2 element
takes precedence.

[#50561028_pgfId-1698795]##This style may be used to refer to stateful
session bean PostConstruct, PreDestroy, PrePassivate or PostActivate
methods to specify their transaction attributes if any of the following

[#50561028_pgfId-1698798]##There is only one method with this name in
the specified enterprise bean

[#50561028_pgfId-1698933]##All overloaded methods with this name in the

 +
This style is used to refer to a single method within a set of methods
with an overloaded name. If there is also a container-transaction
element that uses the Style 2 element for the method name, or the Style
1 element for the bean, the value specified by the Style 3 element takes
precedence.

the container-specific implementation of the resource manager connection
factory object. The resource manager connection factory object allows
the container to obtain the _javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface

bean-managed transaction demarcation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1698052]##Bean-managed transaction demarcation can be
used with session and message-driven beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1698055]##[#50561028_marker-1698053]##The container
must manage client invocations to an enterprise bean instance with
bean-managed transaction demarcation as follows. When a client invokes a
business method via one of the enterprise bean’s client views, the
container suspends any transaction that may be associated with the
client request. If there is a transaction associated with the instance
(this would happen if a stateful session bean instance started the
transaction in some previous business method), the container associates
the method execution with this transaction. If there are interceptor
methods associated with the bean instances, these actions are taken
before the interceptor methods are invoked.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380224]##The container must make the
javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface available to the enterprise
bean’s business method, message listener method, interceptor method, or
timeout callback method via dependency injection into the enterprise
bean class or interceptor class, through lookup via the
javax.ejb.EJBContext interface, and in the JNDI naming context under
java:comp/UserTransaction. When an instance uses the
javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface to demarcate a transaction,
the container must enlist all the resource managers used by the instance
between the begin and commit—or rollback—methods with the
transaction.link:#pgfId-1676091[52] When the instance attempts to commit
the transaction, the container is responsible for the global
coordination of the transaction commitlink:#pgfId-1380227[53].

[#50561028_pgfId-1380228]##In the case of a
[#50561028_marker-1503274]##stateful session bean, it is possible that
the business method or interceptor method that started a transaction
completes without committing or rolling back the transaction. In such a
case, the container must retain the association between the transaction
and the instance across multiple client calls until the instance commits
or rolls back the transaction. When the client invokes the next business
method, the container must invoke the business method (and any
applicable interceptor methods for the bean) in this transaction
context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380229]##If a [#50561028_marker-1503275]##stateless or
singleton session bean instance starts a transaction in a business
method or interceptor method, it must commit the transaction before the
business method (or all its interceptor methods) returns. The container
must detect the case in which a transaction was started, but not
completed, in the business method or interceptor method for the business
method, and handle it as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1380230]##Log this as an application error to alert the
System Administrator.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380231]##Roll back the started transaction.

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1607400]##If this a stateless session bean,
discard the bean instance.link:#pgfId-1676106[54]

[#50561028_pgfId-1607401]##Throw the
_javax.ejb.EJBExceptionlink:#pgfId-1613682[55]_ . If the EJB 2.1 client
view is used, the container should throw thejava.rmi.RemoteException if
the client is a remote client, and the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ if the
client is a local client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380234]##If a
[#50561028_marker-1503276]##message-driven bean instance starts a
transaction in a message listener method or interceptor method, it must
commit the transaction before the message listener method (or all its
interceptor methods) returns. The container must detect the case in
which a transaction was started, but not completed, in a message
listener method or interceptor method for the message listener method,
and handle it as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1380235]##Log this as an application error to alert the
System Administrator.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380236]##Roll back the started transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380237]##Discard the instance of the message-driven
bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1572006]##If a session bean or message-driven bean
instance starts a transaction in a timeout callback method, it must
commit the transaction before the timeout callback method returns. The
container must detect the case in which a transaction was started, but
not completed, in a timeout callback method, and handle it as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1572007]##Log this as an application error to alert the
System Administrator.

[#50561028_pgfId-1572008]##Roll back the started transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1572009]##If this is a stateless session bean or
message-driven bean, discard the instance of the bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380238]##The actions performed by the container for an
instance with bean-managed transaction are summarized by the following
table. T1 is a transaction associated with a client request, T2 is a
transaction that is currently associated with the instance (i.e. a
transaction that was started but not completed by a previous business
method).

[#50561028_pgfId-1716024]##The following subsections define the
responsibilities of the container for managing the invocation of a
message-driven bean’s message listener method. The container’s
responsibilities depend on the value of the transaction attribute.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380486]##Only the _NOT_SUPPORTED_ and _REQUIRED_
transaction attributes may be used for message-driven bean message
listener methods. The use of the other transaction attributes is not
meaningful for message-driven bean message listener methods because
there is no pre-existing client transaction context ( _REQUIRES_NEW_ ,
_SUPPORTS_ ) and no client to handle exceptions ( _MANDATORY_ , _NEVER_
).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380487]##NOT_SUPPORTED

[#50561028_pgfId-1380488]##The container invokes a message-driven bean
message listener method whose [#50561028_marker-1503280]##transaction
attribute is set to NOT_SUPPORTED with an unspecified transaction
context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380489]##If the message listener method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes no transaction context with the
invocation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380490]##REQUIRED

[#50561028_pgfId-1556024]##The container must invoke a message-driven
bean message listener method whose
[#50561028_marker-1503281]##transaction attribute is set to REQUIRED
with a valid transaction context. The resource managers accessed by the
message listener method within the transaction are enlisted with the
transaction. If the message listener method invokes other enterprise
beans, the container passes the transaction context with the invocation.
The container attempts to commit the transaction when the message
listener method has completed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1556043]##Messaging systems may differ in quality of
service with regard to reliability and transactionality of the dequeuing
of messages.

[#50561028_pgfId-1556025]##The requirement for JMS are as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1556026]##A transaction must be started before the
dequeuing of the JMS message and, hence, before the invocation of the
message-driven bean’s _onMessage_ method. The resource manager
associated with the arriving message is enlisted with the transaction as
well as all the resource managers accessed by the _onMessage_ method
within the transaction. If the _onMessage_ method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes the transaction context with the
invocation. The transaction is committed when the _onMessage_ method has
completed. If the _onMessage_ method does not successfully complete or
the transaction is rolled back, message redelivery semantics apply.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380492]##Handling of setRollbackOnly Method

[#50561028_pgfId-1380493]##The container must handle the
[#50561028_marker-1503282]##EJBContext.setRollbackOnly method invoked
from a message listener method executing with the REQUIRED transaction
attribute as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1380494]##The container must ensure that the
transaction will never commit. Typically, the container instructs the
transaction manager to mark the transaction for rollback.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380495]##The container must note that the instance has
invoked the setRollbackOnly method. When the method invocation
completes, the container must roll back rather than commit the
transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380496]##The container must throw and log the
java.lang.IllegalStateException if the EJBContext.setRollbackOnly method
is invoked from a message listener method executing with the
NotSupported transaction attribute

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380497]##Handling of getRollbackOnly Method

[#50561028_pgfId-1380498]##The container must handle the
[#50561028_marker-1503283]##EJBContext.getRollbackOnly() method invoked
from a message listener method executing with the REQUIRED transaction
attribute.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380499]##The container must throw and log the
java.lang.IllegalStateException if the EJBContext.getRollbackOnly method
is invoked from a message listener method executing with the
NOT_SUPPORTED transaction attribute.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380500]##Handling of getUserTransaction Method

[#50561028_pgfId-1645972]##If an instance of a message-driven bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation attempts to invoke the
[#50561028_marker-1645973]##getUserTransaction method of the EJBContext
interface, the container must throw and log the
java.lang.IllegalStateException.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1645975]##Local Transaction Optimization

[#50561028_pgfId-1380503]##The container may use a
[#50561028_marker-1503285]##local transaction optimization for
enterprise beans whose metadata annotations or deployment descriptor
indicates that connections to a resource manager are shareable (see
Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_23196[See Declaration of Resource Manager
Connection Factory References in Deployment Descriptor]). The container
manages the use of the local transaction optimization transparently to
the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380504]##The container may use the optimization for
transactions initiated by the container for a bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation and for transactions initiated
by a bean with bean-managed transaction demarcation with the
_UserTransaction_ interface. The container cannot apply the optimization
for transactions imported from a different container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1426142]##The use of local transaction optimization
approach is discussed in link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50453[See Java™ Platform,

[#50561028_pgfId-1380509]##[#50561028_marker-1380508]##The term “an
unspecified transaction context” is used in the EJB specification to
refer to the cases in which the EJB architecture does not fully define
the transaction semantics of an enterprise bean method execution.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380510]##This includes the following cases:

[#50561028_pgfId-1380511]##The execution of a method of an enterprise
bean with container-managed transaction demarcation for which the value
of the transaction attribute is NOT_SUPPORTED, NEVER, or SUPPORTS.

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1380515]##The execution of a _PostConstruct or
PreDestroy_ callback method of a stateless session bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation.link:#pgfId-1597976[59]

_PreDestroy_ callback method of a message-driven bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation.link:#pgfId-1597989[60]

[#50561028_pgfId-1380517]##The EJB specification does not prescribe how
the container should manage the execution of a method with an
unspecified transaction context—the transaction semantics are left to
the container implementation. Some techniques for how the container may
choose to implement the execution of a method with an unspecified
transaction context are as follows (the list is not inclusive of all
possible strategies):

[#50561028_pgfId-1380518]##The container may execute the method and
access the underlying resource managers without a transaction context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380519]##The container may treat each call of an
instance to a resource manager as a single transaction (e.g. the
container may set the auto-commit option on a JDBC connection).

[#50561028_pgfId-1380520]##The container may merge multiple calls of an
instance to a resource manager into a single transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380521]##The container may merge multiple calls of an
instance to multiple resource managers into a single transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380522]##If an instance invokes methods on other
enterprise beans, and the invoked methods are also designated to run
with an unspecified transaction context, the container may merge the
resource manager calls from the multiple instances into a single
transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380523]##Any combination of the above.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380524]##Since the enterprise bean does not know which
technique the container implements, the enterprise bean must be written
conservatively not to rely on any particular container behavior.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380525]##A failure that occurs in the middle of the
execution of a method that runs with an unspecified transaction context
may leave the resource managers accessed from the method in an
unpredictable state. The EJB architecture does not define how the
application should recover the resource managers’ state after such a
failure.

[#50561028_marker-1716844]##distributed transaction scenario, and
specifies the container’s behavior required for this scenario.

[#50561028_pgfId-1716850]##[#50561028_marker-1716848]##An entity
objectlink:#pgfId-1716856[61] may be accessed by multiple clients in the
same transaction. For example, program A may start a transaction, call
program B and program C in the transaction context, and then commit the
transaction. If programs B and C access the same entity object, the
topology of the transaction creates a diamond.

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1716815]##

Transaction Diamond Scenario with Entity Object

image:Ejb-21.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1716816]##An example (not realistic in practice) is a
client program that tries to perform two purchases at two different
stores within the same transaction. At each store, the program that is
processing the client’s purchase request debits the client’s bank
account.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380559]##It is difficult to implement an EJB server
that handles the case in which programs B and C access an entity object
through different network paths. This case is challenging because many
EJB servers implement the EJB container as a collection of multiple
processes, running on the same or multiple machines. Each client is
typically connected to a single process. If clients B and C connect to
different EJB container processes, and both B and C need to access the
same entity object in the same transaction, the issue is how the
container can make it possible for B and C to see a consistent state of
the entity object within the same transactionlink:#pgfId-1380562[62].

[#50561028_pgfId-1380563]##The above example illustrates a simple
diamond. We use the term [#50561028_marker-1503288]##diamond to refer to
any [#50561028_marker-1503287]##distributed transaction scenario in
which an entity object is accessed in the same transaction through
multiple network paths.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380564]##Note that in the diamond scenario the clients
B and C access the entity object serially. Concurrent access to an
entity object in the same transaction context would be considered an
application programming error, and it would be handled in a
container-specific way.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380565]##Note that the issue of handling diamonds is
not unique to the EJB architecture. This issue exists in all distributed
transaction processing systems.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380566]##The following subsections define the
responsibilities of the EJB Roles when handling distributed transaction
topologies that may lead to a diamond involving an entity object.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380567]##Container Provider’s Responsibilities

[#50561028_pgfId-1380568]##This subsection specifies the EJB container’s
responsibilities with respect to the diamond case involving an entity
objectlink:Ejb.htm#50561028_71796[See Component contract and client view
of entity beans are described in the EJB Optional Features document
[40].].

[#50561028_pgfId-1380569]##The EJB specification requires that the
container provide support for [#50561028_marker-1503289]##local
diamonds. In a local diamond, components A, B, C, and D are deployed in
the same EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1716600]##The EJB specification does not require an EJB
container to support [#50561028_marker-1716599]##distributed diamonds.
In a distributed diamond, a target entity object is accessed from
multiple clients in the same transaction through multiple network paths,
and the clients (programs B and C) are not enterprise beans deployed in
the same EJB container as the target entity object.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380571]##If the Container Provider chooses not to
support distributed diamonds, and if the container can detect that a
client invocation would lead to a diamond, the container should throw
the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ (or java.rmi.RemoteException if the EJB 2.1
remote client view is used).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1380614]##Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

responsibilities with respect to the diamond case involving an entity

of entity beans are described in the EJB Optional Features document
[40].].

[#50561028_pgfId-1380616]##The diamond case is transparent to the Bean
Provider—the Bean Provider does not have to code the enterprise bean
differently for the bean to participate in a diamond. Any solution to
the diamond problem implemented by the container is transparent to the
bean and does not change the semantics of the bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380619]##The Application Assembler and Deployer should
be aware that [#50561028_marker-1503291]##distributed diamonds might
occur. In general, the Application Assembler should try to avoid
creating unnecessary distributed diamonds.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380620]##If a distributed diamond is necessary, the
Deployer should advise the container (using a container-specific API)
that an entity objects of the entity bean may be involved in distributed
diamond scenarios.

[#50561028_pgfId-1380622]##While it is illegal for two clients to access
the same session object, it is possible for applications that use
session beans to encounter the diamond case. For example, program A

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1321911]##[#50561028_34822]##Application Exceptions

[#50561028_pgfId-1321913]##[#50561028_marker-1321912]##An
[#50561028_marker-1503296]##application exception is an exception
defined by the Bean Provider as part of the business logic of an
application. _Application exceptions_ are distinguished from _system
exceptions_ in this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605215]##Enterprise bean business methods use
application exceptions to inform the client of abnormal
application-level conditions, such as unacceptable values of the input
arguments to a business method. A client can typically recover from an
application exception. Application exceptions are not intended for
reporting system-level problems.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605222]##For example, the _Account_ enterprise bean
may throw an application exception to report that a _debit_ operation
cannot be performed because of an insufficient balance. The _Account_
bean should not use an application exception to report, for example, the
failure to obtain a database connection.

[#50561028_pgfId-1731965]##An application exception may be defined in
the _throws_ clause of a method of an enterprise bean’s business
interface, no-interface view, home interface, component interface, or
web service endpoint, or of a message listener method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605229]##An application exception class can either be
a subclass (direct or indirect) of
[#50561028_marker-1605230]##java.lang.Exception (i.e., a “checked
exception”), or a subclass of the java.lang.RuntimeException (an
“unchecked exception”). An application exception may not be a subclass
of the java.rmi.RemoteException. The _java.rmi.RemoteException_ and its
subclasses are reserved for system exceptions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321916]##The
[#50561028_marker-1503301]##javax.ejb.CreateException
[#50561028_marker-1503302]##and javax.ejb.RemoveException and subclasses
thereof are considered to be application exceptions. These exceptions
are used as standard application exceptions to report errors to the
client from the create and remove methods of the EJBHome and/or
EJBLocalHome interfaces of components written to the EJB 2.1 client
view. These exceptions are covered by the rules on application
exceptions that are defined in this chapter.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1321920]##Goals for Exception Handling

[#50561028_pgfId-1321921]##The EJB specification for exception handling
is designed to meet these high-level goals:

[#50561028_pgfId-1321922]##An application exception thrown by an
enterprise bean instance should be reported to the client precisely
(i.e., the client gets the same exception)link:#pgfId-1551100[63].

[#50561028_pgfId-1321923]##An application exception thrown by an
enterprise bean instance should not automatically cause a client’s
transaction to be marked for rollback unless the application exception
was defined to cause transaction rollback. The client should typically
be given a chance to recover from an application exception.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321924]##An unexpected exception that may have left
the instance’s state variables and/or underlying persistent data in an
inconsistent state can be handled safely.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1321925]##Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1321926]##This section describes the view and
responsibilities of the Bean Provider with respect to exception
handling.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1321927]##[#50561028_91930]##Application Exceptions

[#50561028_pgfId-1689616]##[#50561028_marker-1689614]##The Bean Provider
defines application exceptions. Application exception that is a checked
exception is defined as such by being listed in the _throws_ clause of a
method on the bean’s business interface, no-interface view, home
interface, component interface, or web service endpoint. An application
exception that is an unchecked exception is defined as an application
exception by annotating it with the _ApplicationException_ metadata
annotation, or denoting it in the deployment descriptor with the
_application-exception_ element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1729865]##Because application exceptions are intended
to be handled by the client, and not by the System Administrator, they
should be used only for reporting business logic exceptions, not for
reporting system level problems.

[#50561028_pgfId-1729866]##Certain messaging types may define
application exceptions in their message listener interfaces. The
resource adapter in use for the particular messaging type determines how
the exception is processed. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_30765[See Java EE™
Connector Architecture, version 1.7 (Connector).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1321931]##[#50561028_marker-1321930]##The Bean Provider
is responsible for throwing the appropriate application exception from
the business method to report a business logic exception to the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605273]##An application exception does not
automatically result in marking the transaction for rollback unless the
_ApplicationException_ annotation is applied to the exception class and
is specified with the _rollback_ element value _true_ or the
_application-exception_ deployment descriptor element for the exception
specifies the _rollback_ element as _truelink:#pgfId-1731970[64]_ . The
_rollback_ subelement of the _application-exception_ deployment
descriptor element may be explicitly specified to override the
_rollback_ value specified or defaulted by the _ApplicationException_
annotation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605272]##The Bean Provider must do one of the
following to ensure data integrity before throwing an application
exception from an enterprise bean instance:

[#50561028_pgfId-1321932]##Ensure that the instance is in a state such
that a client’s attempt to continue and/or commit the transaction does
not result in loss of data integrity. For example, the instance throws
an application exception indicating that the value of an input parameter
was invalid before the instance performed any database updates.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321933]##If the application exception is not specified
to cause transaction rollback, mark the transaction for rollback using
the EJBContext.setRollbackOnly method before throwing the application
exception. Marking the transaction for rollback will ensure that the
transaction can never commit.

[#50561028_pgfId-1371058]##The Bean Provider is also responsible for
using the standard EJB application exceptions
(javax.ejb.CreateException, javax.ejb.RemoveException,
javax.ejb.FinderException, and subclasses thereof) for beans written to
the EJB 2.1 and earlier client view as described in Subsections
link:../Optional/Chapters.htm#85765[] and
link:../Optional/Chapters.htm#30425[].

[#50561028_pgfId-1321940]##Bean Providers may define subclasses of the
standard EJB application exceptions and throw instances of the
subclasses in the enterprise bean methods. A subclass will typically
provide more information to the client that catches the exception.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659707]##By default, designating an unchecked
exception as an application exception also applies to subclasses of that
exception. This inheritance behavior can be disabled by setting the
inherited element of the ApplicationException annotation to false or by
setting the inherited element of the application-exception deployment
descriptor element to false.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659733]##Example:

[#50561028_pgfId-1659734]##@ApplicationException(rollback=true)

[#50561028_pgfId-1659738]##public class ExceptionA extends
RuntimeException

[#50561028_pgfId-1659745]##public class ExceptionD extends ExceptionC

[#50561028_pgfId-1659769]## _ExceptionA_ is an application exception
that causes the transaction to be marked for rollback.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659763]## _ExceptionB_ is an application exception
that causes the transaction to be marked for rollback.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659773]## _ExceptionC_ is an application exception
that does _not_ cause the transaction to be marked for rollback.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659779]## _ExceptionD_ is not an application
exception.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1321942]##[#50561028_33935]##System Exceptions

[#50561028_pgfId-1350155]##A system exception is an exception that is a
_java.rmi.RemoteException_ (or one of its subclasses) or a
_RuntimeException_ that is not an application exception.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605308]##This subsection describes how the Bean
Provider should handle various system-level exceptions and errors that
an enterprise bean instance may encounter during the execution of a
session bean business method, a message-driven bean message listener
method, an interceptor method, or a callback method (e.g. ejbLoad).

encounter various exceptions or errors that prevent the method from
successfully completing. Typically, this happens because the exception
or error is unexpected, or the exception is expected but the EJB Bean
Provider does not know how to recover from it. Examples of such
exceptions and errors are: failure to obtain a database connection, JNDI
exceptions, unexpected RemoteException from invocation of other
enterprise beanslink:#pgfId-1321948[65], unexpected RuntimeException,
JVM errors, and so on.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321949]##If the enterprise bean method encounters a
system-level exception or error that does not allow the method to
successfully complete, the method should throw a suitable
non-application exception that is compatible with the method’s _throws_
clause. While the EJB specification does not prescribe the exact usage
of the exception, it encourages the Bean Provider to follow these
guidelines:

[#50561028_pgfId-1321950]##If the bean method encounters a system
exception or error, it should simply propagate the error from the bean
method to the container (i.e., the bean method does not have to catch
the exception).

[#50561028_pgfId-1321954]##If the bean method performs an operation that
results in a checked exceptionlink:#pgfId-1321953[66] that the bean
method cannot recover, the bean method should throw the
javax.ejb.EJBException that wraps the original exception.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321955]##Any other unexpected error conditions should
be reported using the javax.ejb.EJBException.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321956]##Note that the javax.ejb.EJBException is a
subclass of the java.lang.RuntimeException, and therefore it does not
have to be listed in the _throws_ clauses of the business methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321957]##The container catches a non-application
exception; logs it (which can result in alerting the System
Administrator); and, unless the bean is a message-driven bean, throws
the _javax.ejb.EJBExceptionlink:#pgfId-1613765[67]_ or, if the web
service client view is used, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ . If the EJB
2.1 client view is used, the container throws the
java.rmi.RemoteException (or subclass thereof) to the client if the
client is a remote client, or throws the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ (or
subclass thereof) to the client if the client is a local client. In the
case of a message-driven bean, the container logs the exception and then
throws a _javax.ejb.EJBException_ that wraps the original exception to
the resource adapter. (See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_30765[See Java EE™
Connector Architecture, version 1.7 (Connector).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322.]).

[#50561028_pgfId-1566235]##The exception that is seen by the client is
described in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_28132[See Container Provider
Responsibilities]. It is determined both by the exception that is thrown
by the container and/or bean and the client view.

[#50561028_pgfId-1610119]##The Bean Provider can rely on the container
to perform the following tasks when catching a non-application
exception:

[#50561028_pgfId-1321958]##The transaction in which the bean method
participated will be rolled back.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321959]##Unless the bean is a singleton session bean,
no other method will be invoked on an instance that threw a
non-application exception.

[#50561028_pgfId-1321960]##This means that unless the bean is a
singleton session bean, the Bean Provider does not have to perform any
cleanup actions before throwing a non-application exception. It is the
container that is responsible for the cleanup.

specifies the container’s handling of exceptions thrown from the other
container-invoked callbacks on the enterprise bean. This subsection
applies to the following callback methods:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322126]##Dependency injection methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322127]##The _PostActivate_ and _PrePassivate_

[#50561028_pgfId-1676781]##The container must handle all exceptions or
errors from these methods as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1676782]##Log the exception or error to bring the
problem to the attention of the System Administrator.

[#50561028_pgfId-1676783]##If the instance is in a transaction, mark the

view or web service client view is used, throw the
java.rmi.RemoteException to the client if the client is a remote client
or throw the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ to the client if the client is a
local client. If the instance executed in the client’s transaction, the
container should throw the
_javax.ejb.EJBTransactionRolledbackExceptionlink:#pgfId-1683997[89]_ .
If the EJB 2.1 client view or web service client view is used, the
container should throw the
javax.transaction.TransactionRolledbackException to a remote client or

because it provides more information to the client. (The client knows
that it is fruitless to continue the transaction.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1322147]##[#50561028_marker-1322146]##The container is
responsible for starting and committing the container-managed
transactions, as described in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_75639[See
Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation for Business Methods]. This
subsection specifies how the container must deal with the exceptions
that may be thrown by the transaction start and commit operations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322151]##If the container fails to start or commit a
container-managed transaction, the container must throw the
_javax.ejb.EJBExceptionlink:#pgfId-1613924[91]_ . If the web service
client view or EJB 2.1 client view is used, the container must throw the
[#50561028_marker-1503312]##java.rmi.RemoteException to a remote or web
service client and the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ to a local client. In
the case where the container fails to start or commit a
container-managed transaction on behalf of a message-driven bean or a
timeout callback method, the container must throw and log the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1642363]##However, the container should not throw the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ or java.rmi.RemoteException if the container
performs a transaction rollback because the transaction has been marked
for rollback and no EJBException or RemoteException would otherwise be
thrown according to sections link:Ejb.htm#50561028_76211[See Exceptions
from a Session Bean’s Business Interface Methods and No-Interface View
Methods] through link:Ejb.htm#50561028_38117[See Non-existing Stateful
Session Object]. In this case, the container must rollback the
transaction and pass the business method result or the application
exception thrown by the business method to the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322153]##Note that some implementations of the
container may retry a failed transaction transparently to the client and
enterprise bean code. Such a container would throw the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ or __ java.rmi.RemoteException or after a
number of unsuccessful tries.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322155]##[#50561028_13458]##Release of Resources

[#50561028_pgfId-1322156]##When the container discards an instance
because of a system exception, the container should release all the
[#50561028_marker-1503313]##resources held by the instance that were
acquired through the resource factories declared in the enterprise bean
environment (See Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_11574[See Resource
Manager Connection Factory References]).

[#50561028_pgfId-1322160]##Note: While the container should release the
connections to the resource managers that the instance acquired through
the resource factories declared in the enterprise bean environment, the
container cannot, in general, release “unmanaged” resources that the
instance may have acquired through the JDK APIs. For example, if the
instance has opened a TCP/IP connection, most container implementations
will not be able to release the connection. The connection will be
eventually released by the JVM garbage collector mechanism.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322163]##[#50561028_marker-1322162]##The EJB 1.0
specification allowed the business methods, ejbCreate, ejbPostCreate,
ejbFind<METHOD>, ejbRemove, and the container-invoked callbacks (i.e.,
the methods defined in the SessionBean and SessionSynchronization
interfaces) implemented in the enterprise bean class to use the
java.rmi.RemoteException to report non-application exceptions to the
container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322164]##This use of the java.rmi.RemoteException was
deprecated in EJB 1.1—enterprise beans written for the EJB 1.1
specification should use the javax.ejb.EJBException instead, and
enterprise beans written for the EJB 2.0 or later specification must use
the javax.ejb.EJBException instead.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322165]##The EJB 1.1 and EJB 2.0 or later
specifications require that a container support the deprecated use of
the java.rmi.RemoteException. The container should treat the
java.rmi.RemoteException thrown by an enterprise bean method in the same
way as it is specified for the javax.ejb.EJBException.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1322168]##[#50561028_26439]##Client’s View of Exceptions

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1322169]##This section describes the client’s view of
exceptions received from an enterprise bean invocation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322171]##[#50561028_marker-1322170]##A client accesses
an enterprise bean either through the enterprise bean’s business
interface (whether local or remote), through the enterprise bean’s
no-interface view, through the enterprise bean’s remote home and remote
component interfaces, through the enterprise bean’s local home and local
component interfaces, or through the enterprise bean’s web service
client view depending on whether the client is written to the EJB 3.x
API or earlier API and whether the client is a remote client, a local
client, or a web service client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1472365]##The methods of the business interface
typically do not throw the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ , regardless of
whether the interface is a remote or local interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1612915]##The remote home interface and the remote
component interface are Java RMI interfaces, and therefore the _throws_
clauses of all their methods (including those inherited from
superinterfaces) include the mandatory
[#50561028_marker-1503314]##java.rmi.RemoteException.The _throws_
clauses may include an arbitrary number of application exceptions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1472375]##The local home and local component interfaces
are both Java local interfaces, and the _throws_ clauses of all their
methods (including those inherited from superinterfaces) must not
include the java.rmi.RemoteException.The _throws_ clauses may include an
arbitrary number of application exceptions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1642580]##The no-interface view is a local view, and
the throws clauses of all its methods must not include the
java.rmi.RemoteException. The throws clauses may include an arbitrary
number of application exceptions.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322172]##Application Exception

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1551267]##Local and Remote Clients

[#50561028_pgfId-1322174]##[#50561028_marker-1322173]##If a client
program receives an application exception from an enterprise bean
invocation, the client can continue calling the enterprise bean. An
[#50561028_marker-1503315]##application exception does not result in the
removal of the EJB object.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322177]##Although the container does not automatically
mark for rollback a transaction because of a thrown application
exception, the transaction might have been marked for rollback by the
enterprise bean instance before it threw the application exception or
the application exception may have been specified to require the
container to rollback the transaction. There are two ways to learn if a
particular application exception results in transaction rollback or not:

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1322178]##Statically. Programmers can check the
documentation of the enterprise bean’s client view interface. The Bean
Provider may have specified (although he or she is not required to) the
application exceptions for which the enterprise bean marks the
transaction for rollback before throwing the
exception.link:#pgfId-1732013[92]

[#50561028_pgfId-1322179]##Dynamically. Clients that are enterprise
beans with container-managed transaction demarcation can use the
getRollbackOnly method of the javax.ejb.EJBContext object to learn if
the current transaction has been marked for rollback; other clients may
use the getStatus method of the javax.transaction.UserTransaction
interface to obtain the transaction status.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1551268]##Web Service Clients

[#50561028_pgfId-1700534]##If a stateless session bean throws an
application exception from one of its web service methods, it is the
responsibility of the container to map the exception to the SOAP fault
specified in the WSDL that describes the port type that the stateless
session bean implements. For Java clients, the exceptions received by
the client are described by the mapping rules in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_34199[See Java™ API for XML-based RPC, version 1.1
(JAX-RPC). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=101.].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1700538]##java.rmi.RemoteException and javax.ejb.EJBException

[#50561028_pgfId-1322182]##As described above, a client receives the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ or the java.rmi.RemoteException as an
indication of a failure to invoke an enterprise bean method or to
properly complete its invocation. The exception can be thrown by the
container or by the communication subsystem between the client and the
container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322183]##If the client receives the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ [#50561028_marker-1612920]## or the
java.rmi.RemoteException exception from a method invocation, the client,
in general, does not know if the enterprise bean’s method has been
completed or not.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322184]##If the client executes in the context of a
transaction, the client’s transaction may, or may not, have been marked
for rollback by the communication subsystem or target bean’s container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322185]##For example, the transaction would be marked
for rollback if the underlying transaction service or the target bean’s
container doubted the integrity of the data because the business method
may have been partially completed. Partial completion could happen, for
example, when the target bean’s method returned with a
_RuntimeException_ exception, or if the remote server crashed in the
middle of executing the business method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322186]##The transaction may not necessarily be marked
for rollback. This might occur, for example, when the communication
subsystem on the client-side has not been able to send the request to
the server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322188]##[#50561028_marker-1322187]##When a client
executing in a transaction context receives an _EJBException_ or a
RemoteException from an enterprise bean invocation, the client may use
either of the following strategies to deal with the exception:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322189]##Discontinue the transaction. If the client is
the transaction originator, it may simply rollback its transaction. If
the client is not the transaction originator, it can mark the
transaction for rollback or perform an action that will cause a
rollback. For example, if the client is an enterprise bean, the
enterprise bean may throw a RuntimeException which will cause the
container to rollback the transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322190]##Continue the transaction. The client may
perform additional operations on the same or other enterprise beans, and
eventually attempt to commit the transaction. If the transaction was
marked for rollback at the time the _EJBException_ or RemoteException
was thrown to the client, the commit will fail.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322191]##If the client chooses to continue the
transaction, the client can first inquire about the transaction status
to avoid fruitless computation on a transaction that has been marked for
rollback. A client that is an enterprise bean with container-managed
transaction demarcation can use the EJBContext.getRollbackOnly method to
test if the transaction has been marked for rollback; a client that is
an enterprise bean with bean-managed transaction demarcation, and other
client types, can use the UserTransaction.getStatus method to obtain the
status of the transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322192]##Some implementations of EJB servers and
containers may provide more detailed exception reporting by throwing an
appropriate subclass of the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ or
java.rmi.RemoteException to the client. The following subsections
describe the several subclasses of the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ and
java.rmi.RemoteException that may be thrown by the container to give the
client more information.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322196]##If a client receives one of these exceptions,
the client knows for certain that the transaction has been marked for

[#50561028_pgfId-1485266]##This chapter describes the interoperability
support for accessing an enterprise bean through the EJB 2.1 remote
client view from clients distributed over a network, and the distributed
interoperability requirements for invocations on enterprise beans from
remote clients that are Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
components. Distributed Interoperability is not defined for the EJB 3.x
remote client view.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485269]##[#50561028_marker-1485268]##The remote home
and remote component interfaces of an enterprise bean’s remote client
view are defined as Java™ RMI [link:Ejb.htm#50561028_12984[See Java
Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/.]]
interfaces. This allows the container to implement the remote home and
remote component interfaces as distributed objects. A client using the
remote home and remote component interfaces can reside on a different
machine than the enterprise bean (location transparency), and the object
references of the remote home and remote component interfaces can be
passed over the network to other applications.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485274]##[#50561028_marker-1485273]##The EJB

Specification. http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2000-01-08.]]. This
makes it possible for EJB container implementors to use RMI-IIOP as the

(JavaServer Pages and servlets) that are deployed on a Java EE compliant
web server provided by one Server Provider must be able to invoke the
business methods of enterprise beans that are deployed on a Java EE
compliant EJB server from another Server Provider.

requirements on the Java EE application developer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485376]##To ensure out-of-the-box interoperability

deploy applications in the Java EE servers, and have the multiple
applications interoperate.

standards bodies (including the IETF, W3C, and OMG) where possible, so
that customers can work with industry standards and use standard

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1485388]##[#50561028_79840]##Interoperability Scenarios

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1485390]##[#50561028_marker-1485389]##This section
presents a number of interoperability scenarios that motivate the
interoperability mechanisms described in later sections of this chapter.
These scenarios are illustrative rather than prescriptive. This section
does not specify requirements for a Java EE product to support these
scenarios in exactly the manner described here.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485391]##Java EE applications are multi-tier,
web-enabled applications. Each application consists of one or more
components, which are deployed in containers. The four types of
containers are:

[#50561028_pgfId-1485392]##EJB containers, which host enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485393]##Web containers, which host JavaServer Pages
(JSPs) and servlet components as well as static documents, including
HTML pages.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485394]##Application client containers, which host
standalone applications.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485395]##Applet containers, which host applets which
may be downloaded from a web site. At this time, there is no requirement
for an applet to be able to directly invoke the remote methods of
enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485396]##The scenarios below describe interactions
between components hosted in these various container types.

[#50561028_pgfId-1676805]## 

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485397]##Interactions Between Web Containers and EJB Containers for E-Commerce Applications

[#50561028_pgfId-1485398]##This scenario occurs for business-to-business
and business-to-consumer interactions over the Internet.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485399]## _Scenario 1: A customer wants to buy a book
from an Internet bookstore. The bookstore’s web site consists of a Java
EE application containing JSPs that form the presentation layer, and
another Java EE application containing enterprise beans that have the
business logic and database access code. The JSPs and enterprise beans
are deployed in containers from different vendors._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485400]## _At deployment time: The enterprise beans
are deployed, and their EJBHome objects are published in the EJB
server’s name service. The Deployer links the EJB reference in the JSP’s
deployment descriptor to the URL of the enterprise bean’s EJBHome
object, which can be looked up from the name service. The transaction
attribute specified in the enterprise bean’s deployment descriptor is
RequiresNew for all business methods. Because the “checkout” JSP
requires secure access to set up payments for purchases, the bookstore’s
administrator configures the “checkout” JSP to require access over HTTPS
with only server authentication. Customer authentication is done using
form-based login. The “book search” JSP is accessed over normal HTTP.
Both JSPs talk with enterprise beans that access the book database. The
web and EJB containers use the same customer realm and have a trust
relationship with each other. The network between the web and EJB
servers is not guaranteed to be secure from attacks._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485401]## _At runtime: The customer accesses the book
search JSP using a browser. The JSP looks up the enterprise bean’s
EJBHome object in a name service, and calls findBooks(...) with the
search criteria as parameters. The web container establishes a secure
session with the EJB container with mutual authentication between the
containers, and invokes the enterprise bean. The customer then decides
to buy a book, and accesses the “checkout” JSP. The customer enters the
necessary information in the login form, which is used by the web server
to authenticate the customer. The JSP invokes the enterprise bean to
update the book and customer databases. The customer’s principal is
propagated to the EJB container and used for authorization checks. The
enterprise bean completes the updates and commits the transaction. The
JSP sends back a confirmation page to the customer._

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485403]##[#50561028_66302]##Interactions Between Application Client Containers and EJB Containers Within an Enterprise’s Intranet

[#50561028_pgfId-1485404]## _Scenario 2.1: An enterprise has an expense
accounting application used by employees from their desktops. The
server-side consists of a Java EE application containing enterprise
beans that are deployed on one vendor's Java EE product, which is hosted
in a datacenter. The client side consists of another Java EE application
containing an application client deployed using another vendor's Java EE
infrastructure. The network between the application client and the EJB
container is insecure and needs to be protected against spoofing and
other attacks._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485405]## _At deployment time: The enterprise beans
are deployed and their EJBHome objects are published in the enterprise’s
name service. The application clients are configured with the names of
the EJBHome objects. The Deployer maps employees to roles that are
allowed access to the enterprise beans. The System Administrator
configures the security settings of the application client and EJB
container to use client and server authentication and message
protection. The System Administrator also does the necessary client-side
configuration to allow client authentication._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485406]## _At runtime: The employee logs on using
username and password. The application client container may interact
with the enterprise’s authentication service infrastructure to set up
the employee’s credentials. The client application does a remote
invocation to the name server to look up the enterprise bean’s EJBHome
object, and creates the enterprise beans. The application client
container uses a secure transport protocol to interact with the name
server and EJB server, which does mutual authentication and also
guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of messages. The employee
then enters the expense information and submits it. This causes remote
business methods of the enterprise beans to be invoked. The EJB
container performs authorization checks and, if they succeed, executes
the business methods._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485407]## _Scenario 2.2: This is the same as Scenario
2.1, except that there is no client-side authentication infrastructure
set up by the System Administrator which can authenticate at the
transport protocol layer. At runtime the client container needs to send
the user’s password to the server during the method invocation to
authenticate the employee._

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485409]##[#50561028_58493]##Interactions Between Two EJB Containers in an Enterprise’s Intranet

[#50561028_pgfId-1485410]## _Scenario 3: An enterprise has an expense
accounting application which needs to communicate with a payroll
application. The applications use enterprise beans and are deployed on
Java EE servers from different vendors. The Java EE servers and
naming/authentication services may be in the enterprise's datacenter
with a physically secure private network between them, or they may need
to communicate across the intranet, which may be less secure. The
applications need to update accounts and payroll databases. The employee
(client) accesses the expense accounting application as described in
Scenario 2._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485411]## _At deployment time: The Deployer configures
both applications with the appropriate database resources. The accounts
application is configured with the name of the EJBHome object of the
payroll application. The payroll bean’s deployment descriptor specifies
the RequiresNew transaction attribute for all methods. The applications
use the same principal-to-role mappings (e.g. the roles may be Employee,
PayrollDept, AccountsDept). The Deployer of these two applications has
administratively set up a trust relationship between the two EJB
containers, so that the containers do not need to authenticate
principals propagated on calls to enterprise beans from the other
container. The System Administrator also sets up the message protection
parameters of the two containers if the network is not physically
secure._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485412]## _At runtime: An employee makes a request to
the accounts application which requires it to access the payroll
application. The accounts application does a lookup of the payroll
application’s EJBHome object in the naming/directory service and creates
enterprise beans. It updates the accounts database and invokes a remote
method of the payroll bean. The accounts bean’s container propagates the
employee’s principal on the method call. The payroll bean’s container
maps the propagated employee principal to a role, does authorization
checks, and sets up the payroll bean’s transaction context. The
container starts a new transaction, then the payroll bean updates the
payroll database, and the container commits the transaction. The
accounts bean receives a status reply from the payroll bean. If an error
occurs in the payroll bean, the accounts bean executes code to recover
from the error and restore the databases to a consistent state._

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485413]##Intranet Application Interactions Between Web Containers and EJB Containers

[#50561028_pgfId-1485414]## _Scenario 4: This is the same as scenario
2.1, except that instead of using a “fat-client” desktop application to
access the enterprise’s expense accounting application, employees use a
web browser and connect to a web server in the intranet that hosts JSPs.
The JSPs gather input from the user (e.g., through an HTML form), invoke
enterprise beans that contain the actual business logic, and format the
results returned by the enterprise beans (using HTML)._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485415]## _At deployment time: The enterprise Deployer
configures its expense accounting JSPs to require access over HTTPS with
mutual authentication. The web and EJB containers use the same customer
realm and have a trust relationship with each other._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485417]##[#50561028_marker-1485416]## _At run-time:
The employee logs in to the client desktop, starts the browser, and
accesses the expense accounting JSP. The browser establishes an HTTPS
session with the web server. Client authentication is performed (for
example) using the employee’s credentials which have been established by
the operating system at login time (the browser interacts with the
operating system to obtain the employee’s credentials). The JSP looks up
the enterprise bean’s EJBHome object in a name service. The web
container establishes a secure session with the EJB container with
mutual authentication and integrity/confidentiality protection between
the containers, and invokes methods on the enterprise beans._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485420]##The
[#50561028_marker-1503322]##interoperability requirements used to
support the above scenarios are:

[#50561028_pgfId-1485421]## Remote method invocation on an enterprise
bean’s EJBObject and EJBHome object references (scenarios 1,2,3,4),
described in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_80429[See Remote Invocation
Interoperability].

[#50561028_pgfId-1485425]## Name service lookup of the enterprise bean’s
EJBHome object (scenarios 1,2,3,4), described in section

[#50561028_pgfId-1485429]##Integrity and confidentiality protection of
messages (scenarios 1,2,3,4), described in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29897[See Security Interoperability].

[#50561028_pgfId-1485436]##Authentication between an application client
and EJB container (described in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29897[See
Security Interoperability]):

[#50561028_pgfId-1485437]##Mutual authentication at the transport
protocol layer when there is client-side authentication infrastructure
such as certificates (scenario 2.1).

[#50561028_pgfId-1485438]##Transfer of the user’s authentication data
from application client to EJB container to allow the EJB container to
authenticate the client when there is no client-side authentication
infrastructure (scenario 2.2).

[#50561028_pgfId-1485439]## Mutual authentication between two EJB
containers or between a web and EJB container to establish trust before
principals are propagated (scenarios 1,3,4), described in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29897[See Security Interoperability].

[#50561028_pgfId-1485443]## Propagation of the Internet or intranet
user’s principal name for invocations on enterprise beans from web or
EJB containers when the client and server containers have a trust
relationship (scenarios 1,3,4), described in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_29897[See Security Interoperability].

[#50561028_pgfId-1485447]##EJB, web, and application client containers
must support the above requirements separately as well as in
combinations.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1485450]##[#50561028_80429]##Remote Invocation Interoperability

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1485452]##[#50561028_marker-1485451]##This section
describes the interoperability mechanisms that enable remote invocations
on EJBObject and EJBHome object references when client containers and
EJB containers are provided by different vendors. This is needed to
satisfy interoperability requirement (1) in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13189[See Overview of Interoperability
Requirements].

[#50561028_pgfId-1485457]##[#50561028_marker-1485456]##All EJB, web, and
application client containers must support the IIOP 1.2 protocol for
remote invocations on EJBObject and EJBHome references. EJB containers
must be capable of servicing IIOP 1.2 based invocations on EJBObject and
EJBHome objects. IIOP 1.2 is part of the CORBA 2.3.1 specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_65984[See CORBA 2.3.1 Specification.
http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07.] from the
OMGlink:#pgfId-1485463[94]. Containers may additionally support
vendor-specific protocols.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485464]##CORBA Interoperable Object References (IORs)
for EJBObject and EJBHome object references must include the GIOP
version number 1.2. The IIOP infrastructure in all Java EE containers
must be able to accept fragmented GIOP messages, although sending
fragmented messages is optional. Bidirectional GIOP messages may
optionally be supported by Java EE clients and servers: if a Java EE
server receives an IIOP message from a client which contains the
_BiDirIIOPServiceContext_ structure, it may or may not use the same
connection for sending requests back to the client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485465]##Since Java applications use Unicode
characters by default, Java EE containers are required to support the
Unicode UTF16 code set for transmission of character and string data (in
the IDL _wchar_ and _wstring_ datatypes). Java EE containers may
optionally support additional code sets. EJBObject and EJBHome IORs must
have the _TAG_CODE_SETS_ tagged component which declares the codesets
supported by the EJB container. IIOP messages which include _wchar_ and
_wstring_ datatypes must have the code sets service context field. The
CORBA 2.3.1 requirements for code set support must be followed by Java
EE containers.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485466]##EJB containers are required to translate Java
types to their on-the-wire representation in IIOP messages using the
Java Language to IDL mapping specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_10009[See IDL To Java™ Language Mapping
Specification. http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2000-01-08.] with the
wire formats for IDL types as described in the GIOP specification in
CORBA 2.3. The following subsections describe the mapping details for
Java types.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485471]##[#50561028_29792]##Mapping Java Remote Interfaces to IDL

[#50561028_pgfId-1485473]##The Java Language to IDL Mapping
specification link:Ejb.htm#50561028_10009[See IDL To Java™ Language
Mapping Specification. http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2000-01-08.]
describes precisely how the remote home and remote component interfaces
of a session bean or an entity beanlink:#pgfId-1717314[95] are mapped to
IDL. This mapping to IDL is typically implicit when Java RMI over IIOP
is used to invoke enterprise beans. Java EE clients use only the Java
RMI APIs to invoke enterprise beans. The client container may use the
CORBA portable Stub APIs for the client-side stubs. EJB containers may
create CORBA Tie objects for each EJBObject or EJBHome object.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485477]##Mapping Value Objects to IDL

[#50561028_pgfId-1485479]##[#50561028_marker-1485478]##The Java
interfaces that are passed by value during remote invocations on
enterprise beans are _javax.ejb.Handle_ , _javax.ejb.HomeHandle_ , and
_javax.ejb.EJBMetaData_ . There may also be application-specific value
types that are passed as parameters or return values on enterprise bean
invocations. In addition, several Java exception classes that are thrown
by remote methods also result in concrete IDL value types. All these
value types are mapped to IDL abstract value types or abstract
interfaces using the rules in the Java Language to IDL Mapping.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485480]##Mapping of System Exceptions

[#50561028_pgfId-1485482]##[#50561028_marker-1485481]##Java system
exceptions, including the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ and its subclasses,

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485520]##Obtaining Stub and Client View Classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1485522]##[#50561028_marker-1485521]##When a Java EE
component (application client, JSP, servlet or enterprise bean) receives
a reference to an EJBObject or EJBHome object through JNDI lookup or as
a parameter or return value of an invocation on an enterprise bean, an
instance of an RMI-IIOP stub class (proxy) for the enterprise bean’s
remote home or remote RMI interface needs to be created. When a
component receives a value object as a parameter or return value of an
enterprise bean invocation, an instance of the value class needs to be
created. The stub class, value class, and other client view classes must
be available to the referencing container (the container hosting the
component that receives the reference or value type).

[#50561028_pgfId-1485524]##[#50561028_marker-1485523]##The client view
classes, including application value classes, must be packaged with the
referencing component’s application, as described in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_94776[See Packaging Requirements].

[#50561028_pgfId-1485528]##Stubs for invoking on EJBHome and EJBObject
references must be provided by the referencing container, for example,
by generating stub classes at deployment time for the EJBHome and
EJBObject interfaces of the referenced beans that are packaged with the
referencing component’s application. Stub classes may or may not follow
the standard RMI-IIOP portable stub architecture.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485529]##Containers may optionally support run-time
downloading of stub and value classes needed by the referencing
container. The CORBA 2.3.1 specification and the Java Language to IDL
Mapping specify how stub and value type implementations are to be
downloaded: using codebase URLs that are either embedded in the
EJBObject or EJBHome’s IOR, or sent in the IIOP message service context,
or marshalled with the value type. The URLs for downloading may
optionally include an HTTPS URL for secure downloading.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485530]##[#50561028_96236]##System Value Classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1485531]##[#50561028_marker-1503325]##System value
classes are [#50561028_marker-1503326]##serializable value classes
implementing the javax.ejb.Handle, javax.ejb.HomeHandle,
javax.ejb.EJBMetaData, java.util.Enumeration, java.util.Collection, and
java.util.Iterator interfaces. These value classes are provided by the
EJB container vendor. They must be provided in the form of a JAR file by
the container hosting the referenced bean. For interoperability
scenarios, if a referencing component would use such
[#50561028_marker-1503327]##system value classes at runtime, the
Deployer must ensure that these system value classes provided by the
container hosting the referenced bean are available to the referencing
component. This may be done, for example, by including these system
value classes in the classpath of the referencing container, or by
deploying the system value classes with the referencing component’s
application by providing them to the deployment tool.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485532]##Implementations of these system value classes
must be portable (they must use only J2SE and Java EE APIs) so that they
can be instantiated in another vendor’s container. If the system value
class implementation needs to load application-specific classes (such as
remote home or remote component interfaces) at runtime, it must use the
thread context class loader. The referencing container must make
application-specific classes available to the system value class
instance at runtime through the thread context class loader.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485533]##HandleDelegate SPI

[#50561028_pgfId-1485534]##The
javax.ejb.spi.[#50561028_marker-1503328]##HandleDelegate service
provider interface defines methods that enable portable implementations
of _Handle_ and _HomeHandle_ that are instantiated in a different
vendor’s container to serialize and deserialize EJBObject and EJBHome
references. The _HandleDelegate_ interface is not used by enterprise
beans or Java EE application components directly.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486560]##EJB, web and application client containers
must provide implementations of the _HandleDelegate_ interface. The
HandleDelegate object must be accessible in the client Java EE
component’s JNDI namespace at the reserved name “
_java:comp/HandleDelegate_ ”. The HandleDelegate object is not exported
outside the container that provides it.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485548]##Portable implementations of _Handle_
[#50561028_marker-1503329]## and _HomeHandle_
[#50561028_marker-1503330]## must look up the HandleDelegate object of
the container in which they are instantiated using JNDI at the name “
_java:comp/HandleDelegate_ ” and use the HandleDelegate object to
serialize and deserialize EJBObject and EJBHome references as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1485549]##Handle and HomeHandle implementation classes
must define writeObject and readObject methods to control their
serialization and deserialization. These methods must not wrap or
substitute the stream objects that are passed to the HandleDelegate
methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485550]##The writeObject method of Handle
implementations must call HandleDelegate.writeEJBObject with the
Handle’s EJBObject reference and the serialization output stream object
as parameters. The HandleDelegate implementation (which is provided by
the client container in which the Handle was instantiated, potentially
from a different vendor) then writes the EJBObject to the output stream.
If the output stream corresponds to an IIOP message, the HandleDelegate
must use the standard IIOP abstract interface format for writing the
EJBObject reference.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485551]##The readObject method of Handle
implementations must call HandleDelegate.readEJBObject with the
serialization input stream object as parameter, and with the stream
positioned at the location where the EJBObject can be read. The
HandleDelegate implementation then reads the EJBObject from the input
stream and returns it to the Handle. If the input stream corresponds to
an IIOP message, the HandleDelegate must use the standard abstract
interface format for reading the EJBObject reference. The HandleDelegate
must ensure that the EJBObject reference is capable of performing
invocations immediately after deserialization. The Handle maintains a
reference to the EJBObject as a transient instance variable and returns
it when the Java EE component calls Handle.getEJBObject.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485552]##The writeObject and readObject methods of
HomeHandle implementation classes must be implemented similarly, by
using HandleDelegate.writeEJBHome and HandleDelegate.readEJBHome
respectively.

described below.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485723]##The transaction attributes of enterprise
beans can be specified per method, while in OTS the entire CORBA object
has the same OTS transaction policy. The rules below ensure that the
transaction context will be propagated if any method of an enterprise
bean needs to execute in the client’s transaction context. However, in
some cases there may be extra performance overhead of propagating the
client’s transaction context even if it will not be used by the
enterprise bean method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485724]##EJBObject and EJBHome references may have the
InvocationPolicy value as either _CosTransactions::SHARED_ or

[#50561028_pgfId-1485732]## _The exception handling behavior described

exception and does not extend_ [#50561028_marker-1485731]##

defined as being successful; hence the client-side OTS library must not
roll back the transaction. This allows application exceptions to be
propagated back to the client without rolling back the transaction, as
required by the exception handling rules in

header.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485745]##The client application component expects a
global transaction to be propagated to the server only if the client’s

options:

references as null. The remaining fields in this “null transaction
context,” such as the transaction identifier, are not interpreted and
may have any value. The “null transaction context” indicates that there
is a global client transaction active but the client container is not
capable of propagating it to the server. The presence of this “null
transaction context” allows the EJB container to determine whether the
Java EE client component expects the client’s global transaction to
propagate to the server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485894]##At deployment time, the Deployer of the

JNDI lookup call) should then be linked to the EJBHome object’s
CosNaming name. At run-time, the client component’s JNDI lookup call

on enterprise beans in intranets. These mechanisms are based on the
CORBA/IIOP protocol.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485905]##Introduction

[#50561028_pgfId-1485906]##The goal of the secure invocation mechanisms
is to support the interoperability requirements described earlier in
this chapter, as well as be capable of supporting security technologies
that are expected to be widely deployed in enterprises, including
Kerberos-based secret key mechanisms and X.509 certificate-based public
key mechanisms.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485908]##[#50561028_marker-1485907]##The
authentication identity (i.e. principal) associated with a Java EE
component is usually that of the user on whose behalf the component is
executinglink:#pgfId-1485911[99]. The principal under which an
enterprise bean invocation is performed is either that of the bean’s
caller or the run-as principal which was configured by the Deployer.
When there is a chain of invocations across a web component and
enterprise beans, an intermediate component may use the principal of the
caller (the initiating client) or the intermediate component may use its
run-as principal to perform an invocation on the callee, depending on
the security identity specified for the intermediate component in its
deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485912]##The security principal associated with a
container depends on the type of container. Application client
containers usually do not have a separate principal associated with them
(they operate under the user’s principal). Web and EJB containers are
typically associated with a security principal of their own (e.g., the
operating system user for the container’s process) which may be
configured by the System Administrator at deployment time. When the
client is a web or EJB container, the difference between the client
component’s principal and the client container’s principal is
significant for interoperability considerations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485913]##Trust Relationships Between Containers, [#50561028_marker-1503338]##Principal Propagation

[#50561028_pgfId-1485937]## 

image:Ejb-26.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1485938]##When there is a chain of multiple invocations
across web components and enterprise beans, intermediate components may
not have access to the authentication data of the initiating client to
provide proof of the client’s identity to the target. In such cases, the
target’s authentication requirements can be satisfied if the target
container trusts the intermediate container to vouch for the
authenticity of the propagated principal. The call is made using the
intermediate container’s principal and authentication data, while also
carrying the propagated principal of the initiating client. The
invocation on the target enterprise bean is authorized and performed
using the propagated principal. This procedure also avoids the overhead
associated with authentication of clients on every remote invocation in
a chain.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485939]##EJB containers are required to provide the
Deployer or Administrator with the tools to configure
[#50561028_marker-1503337]##trust relationships for interactions with
intermediate web or EJB containerslink:#pgfId-1485942[100]. If a trust
relationship is set up, the containers are usually configured to perform
mutual authentication, unless the security of the network can be ensured
by some physical means. If the network is physically secure, the target
EJB container may be configured to trust all client containers. After a
trust relationship is set up, the target EJB container does not need to
independently authenticate the initiating client principal sent by the
intermediate container on invocations. Thus only the principal name of
the initiating client (which may include a realm) needs to be
propagated. After a trust relationship has been established, the target
EJB container must be able to accept invocations carrying only the
principal name of the initiating client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485943]##For the current interoperability needs of
Java EE, it is assumed that [#50561028_marker-1503339]##trust
relationships are transitive, such that if a target container trusts an
intermediate container, it implicitly trusts all containers trusted by
the intermediate container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485944]##If no trust relationship has been set up
between a target EJB container and an intermediate web or EJB container,
the target container must not accept
[#50561028_marker-1503341]##principals propagated from that intermediate
container, hence the target container needs to have access to and
independently verify the initiating client principal’s authentication
data.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485945]##Web and EJB containers are required to
support [#50561028_marker-1503340]##caller propagation mode (where the
initiating client’s principal is propagated down the chain of calls on
enterprise beans) and run-as mode (where the web/EJB component’s run-as
identity is propagated). This is needed for scenarios 1, 3 and 4 where
the internet or intranet user’s principal needs to be propagated to the
target EJB container.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485946]##Application Client Authentication

[#50561028_pgfId-1485948]##[#50561028_marker-1485947]##Application
client containers that have authentication infrastructure (such as
certificates, Kerberos) can:

[#50561028_pgfId-1485949]##authenticate the user by interacting with an
authentication service (e.g. the [#50561028_marker-1503342]##Kerberos
KDC) in the enterprise

[#50561028_pgfId-1485950]##inherit an authentication context which was
established at system login time from the operating system process, or

[#50561028_pgfId-1485951]##obtain the user’s
[#50561028_marker-1503343]##certificate from a client-side store.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485953]##[#50561028_marker-1485952]##These may be
achieved by plugging in a [#50561028_marker-1503344]##Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login module for the
particular authentication service. After authentication is completed, a
credential is associated with the client’s thread of execution, which is
used for all invocations on enterprise beans made from that thread.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485954]##If there is no authentication infrastructure
installed in the client’s environment, or the authentication
infrastructure is not capable of authenticating at the transport
protocol layer, the client may send its private credentials (e.g.
password) over a secure connection to the EJB server, which
authenticates the user by interacting with an authentication service
(e.g. a secure user/password database). This is similar to the basic
authentication feature of HTTP.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485955]##Securing EJB Invocations

[#50561028_pgfId-1485957]##[#50561028_marker-1485956]##This subsection
describes the interoperable protocol requirements for providing
authentication, protection of integrity and confidentiality, and
principal propagation for invocations on enterprise beans. The
invocation takes place over an enterprise’s intranet as described in the
scenarios in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_79840[See Interoperability
Scenarios]. Since EJB invocations use the IIOP protocol, we need to
secure IIOP messages between client and server containers. The client
container may be any of the Java EE containers; the server container is
an EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1485961]##The [#50561028_marker-1503345]##secure
interoperability requirements for EJB 2.0 (and later) and other J2EE 1.3
(and later) containers are based on Conformance Level 0 of the Common
Secure Interoperability version 2 (CSIv2) Final Available specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_91024[See Common Secure Interoperability Version 2
Final Available Specification.
http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2001-06-17.], which was developed by
the OMG. EJB, web, and application client containers must support all
requirements of Conformance Level 0 of the CSIv2 specification. The
following subsections describe how the CSIv2 features are used to
realize the scenarios described in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_79840[See Interoperability Scenarios].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1485971]##Secure Transport Protocol

[#50561028_pgfId-1485973]##[#50561028_marker-1485972]##The Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL 3.0) protocol link:Ejb.htm#50561028_78782[See The SSL
Protocol Version 3.0. http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6101.] and the
related IETF standard [#50561028_marker-1503346]##Transport Layer
Security (TLS 1.0) protocol link:Ejb.htm#50561028_44015[See RFC 2246:
The TLS Protocol. ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2246.txt.] provide
authentication and message protection (that is, integrity and/or
confidentiality) at the transport layer. The original SSL and TLS
specifications supported only X.509 certificates for authenticating
principals. Recently, Kerberos-based authentication mechanisms and
cipher suites have been defined for TLS (RFC 2712
_link:Ejb.htm#50561028_44286[See RFC 2712: Addition of Kerberos Cipher
Suites to Transport Layer Security.
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2712.txt.]). Thus the TLS specification is
capable of supporting the two main security technologies that are
expected to be widely deployed in enterprises._

[#50561028_pgfId-1485983]##EJB, web and application client containers
are required to support both SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 as security protocols
for IIOP. This satisfies interoperability requirement 3 in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13189[See Overview of Interoperability
Requirements]. Compliant containers must be capable of using the
following public key SSL/TLS [#50561028_marker-1503347]##ciphersuites
based on policies set by the System Administrator:

[#50561028_pgfId-1486001]## _Support for Kerberos ciphersuites is not
specified._

[#50561028_pgfId-1486002]## _When using IIOP over SSL, a secure channel
between client and server containers is established at the SSL layer.
The SSL handshake layer handles authentication (either mutual or
server-only) between containers, negotiation of cipher suite for bulk
data encryption, and optionally provides a compression method. The SSL
record layer performs confidentiality and integrity protection_
[#50561028_marker-1503348]##on application data. Since compliant Java EE
products are already required to support SSL (HTTPS for Internet
communication), the use of SSL/TLS provides a relatively easy route to
interoperable security at the transport layer.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1486003]##Security Information in IORs

[#50561028_pgfId-1486005]##[#50561028_marker-1486004]##Before initiating
a secure connection to the EJB container, the client needs to know the
hostname and port number at which the server is listening for SSL
connections, and the security protocols supported or required by the
server object. This information is obtained from the EJBObject or
EJBHome reference’s IOR.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486009]##The CSIv2 specification

http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2001-06-17.] describes the
_TAG_CSI_SEC_MECH_LIST_ tagged component which is included in the IORs
of secured objects. This component contains a sequence of
_CSIIOP::CompoundSecMech_ structures (in decreasing order of the
server’s preference) that contain the target object’s security
information for transport layer and service context layer mechanisms.
This information includes the server’s SSL/TLS port, its security
principal and supported/required security mechanisms.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486010]##EJB containers must be capable of inserting
the CSIv2 tagged components into the IORs for EJBObject and EJBHome
references, based on the Deployer or System Administrator’s security
policy settings. Compliant EJB containers must follow the Conformance
Level 0 rules described in the CSIv2 specification for constructing
these IORs.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486011]## _EJB containers must also be capable of
creating IORs that allow access to enterprise beans over unprotected
IIOP, based on the security policies set by the Deployer or System
Administrator._

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1486012]##Propagating Principals and Authentication Data in IIOP Messages

[#50561028_pgfId-1486014]##[#50561028_marker-1486013]##In scenarios
where client authentication does not occur at the transport layer it is
necessary to support transfer of authentication data between two
containers in the IIOP message service context. When an intermediate
client container does not have authentication data for the initiating
client, it is necessary to support propagation of client principals in
the IIOP message service context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486015]##It is assumed that all information exchanged
between client and server at the transport layer is also available to
the containers: e.g. the certificates used for authentication at the SSL
layer may be used by the server container for authorization.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486035]##

[#50561028_pgfId-1486036]##The following cases are required to be
supported:

[#50561028_pgfId-1486037]##Application client invocations on enterprise
beans with [#50561028_marker-1503350]##mutual authentication between the
application client and EJB container (C and S1) at the SSL layer
(scenario 2.1 in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_66302[See Interactions
Between Application Client Containers and EJB Containers Within an
Enterprise’s Intranet], interoperability requirement 4.1 in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13189[See Overview of Interoperability
Requirements]). For example, this is possible when the enterprise has a
Kerberos-based authentication infrastructure or when client-side
certificates have been installed. In this case the security context of
the IIOP message sent from C to S1 should not contain any additional
information.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486044]##Application client invocations on enterprise
beans with [#50561028_marker-1503349]##server-only authentication

Interactions Between Application Client Containers and EJB Containers
Within an Enterprise’s Intranet], interoperability requirement 4.2 in
section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13189[See Overview of Interoperability
Requirements]). This usually happens when the client cannot authenticate
in the transport. In this case, the client container must be capable of
inserting into the IIOP message a CSIv2 security context with a client
authentication token that contains the client C’s authentication data.
Once the EJB container S1 has authenticated the client, it may or may
not maintain state about the client, so subsequent invocations from the
client on the same network connection may need to be authenticated
again. The client and server containers must follow the Conformance
Level 0 rules in the CSIv2 specification for client authentication. In
particular, support for the GSSUP username-password authentication
mechanism is required. Support for other
[#50561028_marker-1503351]##GSSAPI mechanisms (such as Kerberos) to
perform client authentication at the IIOP layer is optional.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486051]##Invocations from Web/EJB clients to

in an Enterprise’s Intranet], interoperability requirements five and six
in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13189[See Overview of Interoperability
Requirements]). S2 does not need to independently authenticate the
initiating client C. In this case the client container S1 must insert
into the IIOP message a security context with an identity token in the
format described in the CSIv2 specification. The principal may be
propagated as an [#50561028_marker-1503352]##X.509 certificate chain or
as a [#50561028_marker-1503353]##X.501 distinguished name or as a
principal name encoded in the GSS exported name format, as described in
the CSIv2 specification. The identity propagated is determined as
follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1486058]##If the client Web/EJB component is configured
to use caller identity, and the caller C authenticated itself to S1,
then the identity token contains the initiating client C’s identity.

caller identity, and the caller C did not authenticate itself to S1,
then the identity token contains the anonymous type.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486060]##If the client component is configured to use
a run-as identity then the identity token contains the run-as identity.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486061]##Java EE containers are required to support
the stateless mode of propagating principal and authentication
information defined in CSIv2 (where the server does not store any state
for a particular client principal across invocations), and may
optionally support the stateful mode.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486062]##The caller principal String provided by
_EJBContext.getCallerPrincipal().getName()_ is defined as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1486063]##For case one, the principal should be derived
from the distinguished name obtained from the first X.509 certificate in
the client’s certificate chain that was provided to the server during
SSL mutual authentication.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486064]##For case two, the principal should be derived
from the username obtained from the client authentication token in the
CSIv2 security context of the IIOP message. For the GSSUP
username-password mechanism, the principal should be derived from the
username in the _GSSUP::InitialContextToken_ structure.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486065]##For case three, the principal depends on the
identity token type in the [#50561028_marker-1503356]##CSIv2 security
context:

[#50561028_pgfId-1486066]##If the type is

should be derived from the distinguished name from the first certificate
in the chain.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486067]##If the type is distinguished name, then the
principal should be derived from the distinguished name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486068]##If the type is principal name propagated as a
GSS exported name, then the principal should be derived from the
mechanism-specific principal name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1486069]##If the anonymous principal type was
propagated or the identity token was absent, then

[#50561028_pgfId-1322280]##This chapter specifies how enterprise beans
declare dependencies on external resources and other objects in their
environment, and how those items can be injected into enterprise beans
or accessed in the JNDI naming context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322282]##The Application Assembler and Deployer should
be able to customize an enterprise bean’s business logic without
accessing the enterprise bean’s source code.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322283]##In addition, ISVs typically develop
enterprise beans that are, to a large degree, independent from the
operational environment in which the application will be deployed. Most
enterprise beans must access resource managers and external information.
The key issue is how enterprise beans can locate external information
without prior knowledge of how the external information is named and
organized in the target operational environment. The JNDI naming context
and Java language metadata annotations provide this capability.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322284]##The enterprise bean environment mechanism
attempts to address both of the above issues.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322285]##This chapter is organized as follows.

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1322301]##[#50561028_marker-1322300]##The enterprise
bean’s environment is a mechanism that allows customization of the
enterprise bean’s business logic during deployment or assembly. The
enterprise bean’s environment allows the enterprise bean to be
customized without the need to access or change the enterprise bean’s
source code.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322302]##Annotations and deployment descriptors are
the main vehicles for conveying access information to the Application
Assembler and Deployer about beans’ requirements for customization of
business logic and access to external information.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624554]##The container implements the enterprise
bean’s environment, and provides it as a JNDI naming context. The
enterprise bean’s environment is used as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322303]##The enterprise bean makes use of entries from
the environment. Entries from the environment may be injected by the
container into the bean’s fields or methods, or the methods of the bean
may access the environment using the EJBContext _lookup_ method or the
JNDI interfaces. The Bean Provider declares in Java language metadata
annotations or in the deployment descriptor all the environment entries
that the enterprise bean expects to be provided in its environment at
runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322304]##The container provides an implementation of
the JNDI naming context that stores the enterprise bean environment. The
container also provides the tools that allow the Deployer to create and
manage the environment of each enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322305]##The Deployer uses the tools provided by the
container to create and initialize the environment entries that are
declared by means of the enterprise bean’s annotations or deployment
descriptor. The Deployer can set and modify the values of the
environment entries.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322306]##The container injects entries from the
environment into the enterprise bean’s fields or methods as specified by
the bean’s metadata annotations or the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602791]##The container makes the environment naming
context available to the enterprise bean instances at runtime. The
enterprise bean’s instances can use the EJBContext _lookup_ method or
the JNDI interfaces to obtain the values of the environment entries.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628702]##The container must make an enterprise bean’s
environment available to any interceptor class and any JAX-WS message
handler for the bean as well. The interceptor and web service handler
classes for an enterprise bean share that bean’s environment. Within the
context of this chapter, the term “bean” should be construed as
including a bean’s interceptor and handler classes unless otherwise
noted.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322307]##[#50561028_88972]##Sharing of Environment Entries

[#50561028_pgfId-1604041]##For enterprise beans packaged in a standalone
ejb-jar file or in an ejb-jar file within an _.ear_ file, each
enterprise bean defines its own set of
[#50561028_marker-1503360]##environment entries. In this case, all
instances of an enterprise bean share the same environment entries; the
environment entries are not shared with other enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1644737]##In a _.war_ file, there is only a single
naming environment shared between all the components in the module. For
enterprise beans packaged in a _.war_ file, all enterprise beans share
this single naming environment. The enterprise beans share their
environment entries with all other enterprise bean components and web
components in the _.wa_ r file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1644736]##Enterprise bean instances are not allowed to
modify the bean’s environment at runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322308]##If an enterprise bean written to the EJB 2.1
API specification is deployed multiple times in the same container, each
deployment results in the creation of a distinct home. The Deployer may
set different values for the enterprise bean environment entries for
each home.

[#50561028_pgfId-1558706]##In general, lookups of objects in the JNDI
_java:_ namespace are required to return a new instance of the requested
object every time. Exceptions are allowed for the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1558707]##The container knows the object is immutable
(for example, objects of type _java.lang.String_ ), or knows that the
application can’t change the state of the object.

[#50561028_pgfId-1558708]##The object is defined to be a singleton, such
that only one instance of the object may exist in the JVM.

[#50561028_pgfId-1558709]##The name used for the lookup is defined to
return an instance of the object that might be shared. The name
_java:comp/ORB_ is such a name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1604045]##In these cases, a shared instance of the
object may be returned. In all other cases, a new instance of the
requested object must be returned on each lookup. Note that, in the case
of resource adapter connection objects, it is the resource adapter’s
_ManagedConnectionFactory_ implementation that is responsible for
satisfying this requirement.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602803]##Each injection of an object corresponds to a
JNDI lookup. Whether a new instance of the requested object is injected,
or whether a shared instance is injected, is determined by the rules
described above.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322309]##Terminology warning: The enterprise bean’s
“environment” should not be confused with the “environment properties”
defined in the JNDI documentation.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1602806]##[#50561028_18961]##Annotations for Environment Entries

[#50561028_pgfId-1602813]##A field or method of a bean class may be
annotated to request that an entry from the bean’s environment be
injected. Any of the types of resources or other environment
entrieslink:#pgfId-1624853[102] described in this chapter may be
injected. Injection may also be requested using entries in the
deployment descriptor corresponding to each of these resource types. The
field or method may have any access qualifier ( _public_ , _private_ ,
etc.) but must not be _static_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1602840]##A field of the bean class may be the target
of injection. The field must not be _final_ . By default, the name of
the field is combined with the name of the class in which the annotation
is used and is used directly as the name in the bean’s naming context.
For example, a field named _myDatabase_ in the class _MySessionBean_ in
the package _com.acme.example_ would correspond to the JNDI name
_java:comp/env/com.acme.example.MySessionBean/myDatabase_ . The
annotation also allows the JNDI name to be specified explicitly.

[#50561028_pgfId-1609925]##Environment entries may also be injected into
the bean through bean methods that follow the naming conventions for
JavaBeans properties. The annotation is applied to the _set_ method for
the property, which is the method that is called to inject the
environment entry. The JavaBeans property name (not the method name) is
used as the default JNDI name. For example, a method named
_setMyDatabase_ in the same _MySessionBean_ class would correspond to
the JNDI name _java:comp/env/com.example.MySessionBean/myDatabase_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1609928]##When a deployment descriptor entry is used to
specify injection, the JNDI name and the instance variable name or
property name are both specified explicitly. Note that the JNDI name is
always relative to the _java:comp/env_ naming context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602878]##Each resource may only be injected into a
single field or method of the bean. Requesting injection of the
_java:comp/env/com.example.MySessionBean/myDatabase_ resource into both
the _setMyDatabase_ method and the _myDatabase_ instance variable is an
error. Note, however, that either the field or the method could request
injection of a resource of a different (non-default) name. By explicitly
specifying the JNDI name of a resource, a single resource may be
injected into multiple fields or methods of multiple classes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602890]##Annotations may also be applied to the bean
class itself. These annotations declare an entry in the bean’s
environment, but do not cause the resource to be injected. Instead, the
bean is expected to use the EJBContext _lookup_ method or the methods of
the JNDI API to lookup the entry. When the annotation is applied to the
bean class, the JNDI name and the environment entry type must be
explicitly specified.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624573]##Annotations may appear on the bean class, or
on any superclass. A resource annotation on any class in the inheritance
hierarchy defines a resource needed by the bean. However, injection of
such resources follows the Java language overriding rules for the
visibility of fields and methods. A method definition that overrides a
method on a superclass defines the resource, if any, to be injected into
that method. An overriding method may request injection of a different
resource than is requested by the superclass, or it may request no
injection even though the superclass method requests injection.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624578]##In addition, fields or methods that are not
visible in or are hidden (as opposed to overridden) by a subclass may
still request injection. This allows, for example, a private field to be
the target of injection and that field to be used in the implementation
of the superclass, even though the subclass has no visibility into that
field and doesn’t know that the implementation of the superclass is
using an injected resource. Note that a declaration of a field in a
subclass with the same name as a field in a superclass always causes the
field in the superclass to be hidden.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1602894]##[#50561028_28325]##Annotations and Deployment Descriptors

[#50561028_pgfId-1634319]##Environment entries may be declared by the
use of annotations, without need for any deployment descriptor entries.
Environment entries may also be declared by deployment descriptor
entries, without need for any annotations. The same environment entry
may be declared using both an annotation and a deployment descriptor
entry. In this case, the information in the deployment descriptor entry
may be used to override some of the information provided in the
annotation. This approach may be used by an Application Assembler to
override information provided by the Bean Provider. Deployment
descriptor entries should not be used to request injection of a resource
into a field or method that has not been designed for injection.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624594]##The following rules apply to how a deployment
descriptor entry may override a _Resource_ annotation:

[#50561028_pgfId-1602900]##The relevant deployment descriptor entry is
located based on the JNDI name used with the annotation (either
defaulted or provided explicitly).

[#50561028_pgfId-1602901]##The type specified in the deployment
descriptor must be assignable to the type of the field or property or
the type specified in the _Resource_ annotation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602902]##The description, if specified, overrides the
description element of the annotation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602903]##The injection target, if specified, must name
exactly the annotated field or property method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727192]##The mapped-name element, if specified,
overrides the mappedName element of the annotation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624587]##The _res-sharing_ -scope element, if
specified, overrides the _shareable_ element of the annotation. In
general, the Application Assembler or Deployer should never change the
value of this element, as doing so is likely to break the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624588]##The _res-auth_ element, if specified,
overrides the _authenticationType_ element of the annotation. In
general, the Application Assembler or Deployer should never change the
value of this element, as doing so is likely to break the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727064]##The lookup-name element, if specified,
overrides the lookup element of the annotation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602904]##Restrictions on the overriding of environment
entry values depend on the type of environment entry.

[#50561028_pgfId-1624604]##The rules for how a deployment descriptor
entry may override an EJB annotation are described in Section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_15618[See EJB References]. The rules for how a
deployment descriptor entry may override a _PersistenceUnit_ or
_PersistenceContext_ annotation are described in Sections
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_27067[See Persistence Unit References] and
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_48657[See Persistence Context References]. The
rules for web services references and how a deployment descriptor entry

[#50561028_pgfId-1605344]##This section describes the responsibilities
of the various EJB roles with regard to the specification and handling
of environment entries. The sections that follow describe the
responsibilities that are specific to the different types of objects
that may be stored in the naming context.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322312]##[#50561028_15410]##Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

[#50561028_pgfId-1602933]##The Bean Provider may use Java language
annotations or deployment descriptor entries to request injection of a
resource from the naming context, or to declare entries that are needed
in the naming context. The Bean Provider may also use the _EJBContext_
_lookup_ method or the JNDI APIs to access entries in the naming
context. Deployment descriptor entries may also be used by the Bean
Provider to override information provided by annotations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322316]##When using JNDI interfaces directly, an
enterprise bean instance creates a javax.naming.InitialContext object by
using the constructor with no arguments, and looks up the environment
naming via the InitialContext under the name java:comp/env.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602944]##The enterprise bean’s environment entries are
stored directly in the environment naming context, or in any of its
direct or indirect subcontexts.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322317]##The value of an environment entry is of the
Java type declared by the Bean Provider in the metadata annotation or
deployment descriptor, or the type of the instance variable or setter
method parameter of the method with which the metadata annotation is
associated.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1602950]##Application Assembler’s Responsibility

[#50561028_pgfId-1602952]##[#50561028_marker-1602951]##The Application
Assembler is allowed to modify the values of the environment entries set
by the Bean Provider, and is allowed to set the values of those
environment entries for which the Bean Provider has not specified any
initial values. The Application Assembler uses the deployment descriptor
to override settings made by the Bean Provider, whether these were
defined by the Bean Provider in the deployment descriptor or in the
source code using annotations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1602953]##Deployer’s Responsibility

[#50561028_pgfId-1602954]##The Deployer must ensure that the values of
all the environment entries declared by an enterprise bean are created
and/or set to meaningful values.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602956]##[#50561028_marker-1602955]##The Deployer can
modify the values of the environment entries that have been previously
set by the Bean Provider and/or Application Assembler, and must set the

[#50561028_pgfId-1602990]##The Container Provider has the following
responsibilities:

[#50561028_pgfId-1602991]##Provide a deployment tool that allows the
Deployer to set and modify the values of the enterprise bean’s
environment entries.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602992]##Implement the java:comp/env, java:module,
java:app and java:global environment naming contexts, and provide them
to the enterprise bean instances at runtime. The naming context must
include all the environment entries declared by the Bean Provider, with
their values supplied in the deployment descriptor or set by the
Deployer. The environment naming context must allow the Deployer to
create subcontexts if they are needed by an enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602997]##Inject entries from the naming environment,
as specified by annotations or by the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1602993]##The container must ensure that the enterprise

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1603024]##[#50561028_27918]##Injection of Simple Environment Entries Using Annotations

[#50561028_pgfId-1603028]##The Bean Provider uses the _Resource_
annotation to annotate a field or method of the bean class as a target
for the injection of a simple environment entry. The name of the
environment entry is as described in link:Ejb.htm#50561028_18961[See
Annotations for Environment Entries]; the type is as described in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42809[See Simple Environment Entries]. Note that
the container will unbox the environment entry as required to match it
to a primitive type used for the injection field or method. The
_authenticationType_ and _shareable_ elements of the _Resource_
annotation must not be specified: simple environment entries are not
shareable and do not require authentication.

[#50561028_pgfId-1603041]##The following code example illustrates how an
enterprise bean uses annotations for the injection of environment
entries.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322318]##Programming Interfaces for Accessing Simple Environment Entries

[#50561028_pgfId-1603116]##In addition to the use of injection as
described above, an enterprise bean may access environment entries
dynamically. This may be done by means of the EJBContext _lookup_ method
or by direct use of the JNDI interfaces. The environment entries are
declared by the Bean Provider by means of annotations on the bean class
or in the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1605345]##When the JNDI interfaces are used directly,
the bean instance creates a _javax.naming.InitialContext_ object by
using the constructor with no arguments, and looks up the naming
environment via the _InitialContext_ under the name _java:comp/env_ .
The bean’s environmental entries are stored directly in the environment
naming context, or its direct or indirect subcontexts.

[#50561028_pgfId-1603121]##The following code example illustrates how an
enterprise bean accesses its environment entries when the JNDI APIs are
used directly. In this example, the names under which the entries are
accessed are defined by the deployment descriptor, as shown in the
example of section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_23635[See Declaration of Simple
Environment Entries in the Deployment Descriptor].

[#50561028_pgfId-1322360]##Each env-entry deployment descriptor element
describes a single environment entry. The env-entry element consists of
an optional description of the environment entry, the environment entry
name relative to the java:comp/env context, the expected Java type of

the EJBContext or JNDI lookup method), and an optional environment entry
value.

describes the programming and deployment descriptor interfaces that
allow the Bean Provider to refer to the business interfaces,
no-interface views, or home interfaces of other enterprise beans using
“logical” names called EJB references. The EJB references are special
entries in the enterprise bean’s environment. The Deployer binds the EJB
references to the enterprise bean business interfaces, no-interface
views, or home interfaces in the target operational environment, as
appropriate.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322432]##The deployment descriptor also allows the
Application Assembler to link an EJB reference declared in one
enterprise bean to another enterprise bean contained in the same ejb-jar
file, or in another ejb-jar file in the same Java EE application unit.
The link is an instruction to the tools used by the Deployer that the
EJB reference should be bound to the business interface, no-interface
view, or home interface of the specified target enterprise bean. This
linking can also be specified by the Bean Provider using annotations in
the source code of the bean class.

elements:

[#50561028_pgfId-1695970]##The name element refers to the name by which
the resource is to be looked up in the environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1695988]##The beanInterface element is the referenced
interface type. The reference may be to a session bean’s business
interface, to a session bean’s no-interface view, or to the local home

the name element of the Stateful or Stateless annotation (or ejb-name
element, if the deployment descriptor was used to define the name of th

[#50561028_pgfId-1603747]##[#50561028_marker-1399633]##Although the EJB
reference is an entry in the enterprise bean’s environment, the Bean
Provider must not use a env-entry element to declare it. Instead, the
Bean Provider must declare all the EJB references using the ejb-ref and
_ejb-local-ref_ elements of the deployment descriptor. This allows the
ejb-jar consumer (i.e. Application Assembler or Deployer) to discover
all the EJB references used by the enterprise bean. Deployment
descriptor entries may also be used to specify injection of an EJB
reference into a bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1399636]##Each ejb-ref or _ejb-local-ref_
[#50561028_marker-1503368]## element describes the interface
requirements that the referencing enterprise bean has for the referenced
enterprise bean. The _ejb-ref_ element is used for referencing an
enterprise bean that is accessed through its remote business interface
or remote home and component interfaces. The _ejb-local-ref_
[#50561028_marker-1503369]## element is used for referencing an
enterprise bean that is accessed through its local business interface,
no-interface view, local home and component interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1609220]##The ejb-ref element contains the description,
ejb-ref-name, ejb-ref-type, home, remote, ejb-link, and lookup-name
elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1668457]##The ejb-local-ref element contains the
description, ejb-ref-name, ejb-ref-type, _local-home_ , local, ejb-link,
and lookup-name elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322472]##The [#50561028_marker-1503370]##ejb-ref-name
element specifies the EJB reference name: its value is the environment
entry name used in the enterprise bean code. The _ejb-ref-name_ must be
specified.

[#50561028_pgfId-1684062]##The optional
[#50561028_marker-1684061]##ejb-ref-type element specifies the expected
type of the enterprise bean: its value must be either
Entitylink:#pgfId-1717464[104] or Session.

[#50561028_pgfId-1684065]##The home and remote or _local-home_
[#50561028_marker-1684063]## and _local_ [#50561028_marker-1684064]##
elements specify the expected Java types of the referenced enterprise
bean’s interface(s). If the reference is to an EJB 2.1 remote client
view interface, the _home_ element is required. Likewise, if the
reference is to an EJB 2.1 local client view interface, the _local-home_
element is required. The _remote_ element of the _ejb-ref_ element
refers to either the remote business interface type or the remote
component interface, depending on whether the reference is to a bean’s
EJB 3.x or EJB 2.1 remote client view. Likewise, the _local_ element of
the _ejb-local-ref_ element refers to either the local business
interface type, bean class type or the local component interface type,
depending on whether the reference is to a bean’s EJB 3.x local business
interface, no-interface view, or EJB 2.1 local client view respectively.

[#50561028_pgfId-1604254]##[#50561028_marker-1322514]##The Application
Assembler can use the ejb-link element in the deployment descriptor to
link an EJB reference to a target enterprise bean within the same
application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322516]##The Application Assembler specifies the link
between two enterprise beans as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1395337]##The Application Assembler uses the optional
ejb-link element of the ejb-ref or _ejb-local-ref_ element of the
referencing enterprise bean. The value of the ejb-link element is the
name of the target enterprise bean. (This is the bean name as defined by
metadata annotation (or default) in the bean class or in the _ejb-name_
element of the target enterprise bean.) The target enterprise bean can
be in any ejb-jar file or _.war_ file in the same Java EE application as
the referencing application component.

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1399569]##Alternatively, to avoid the need to
rename enterprise beans to have unique names within an entire Java EE
application, the Application Assembler may use either of the following
two syntaxes in the _ejb-link_ element of the referencing application
component. link:#pgfId-1650538[105]

[#50561028_pgfId-1650518]##The Application Assembler specifies the
module name of the ejb-jar file or _.war_ file containing the referenced
enterprise bean and appends the ejb-name of the target bean separated by
/. The module name is the name of the module in which the enterprise
bean is packaged, with no filename extension, unless the _module-name_
element is specified in the module’s deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650514]##The Application Assembler specifies the path
name of the ejb-jar file or _.war_ file containing the referenced
enterprise bean and appends the ejb-name of the target bean separated
from the path name by _#_ . The path name is relative to the referencing
application component jar file. In this manner, multiple beans with the
same ejb-name may be uniquely identified when the Application Assembler
cannot change ejb-names.

[#50561028_pgfId-1395323]##Rather than using ejb-link to resolve the EJB
reference, the Application Assembler may use the _lookup-name_ element
to reference the target EJB component by means of one of its JNDI names.
It is an error for both ejb-link and lookup-name to be specified within
an _ejb-ref_ or _ejb-local-ref_ element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1668471]##The Application Assembler must ensure that
the target enterprise bean is type-compatible with the declared EJB
reference. This means that the target enterprise bean must be of the
type indicated in the ejb-ref-type element, if present, and that the
business interface, bean class, or home and component interfaces of the
target enterprise bean must be Java type-compatible with the type
declared in the EJB reference.

[#50561028_pgfId-1635744]##The following rules apply to how a deployment
descriptor entry may override an _EJB_ annotation:

[#50561028_pgfId-1635745]##The relevant deployment descriptor entry is
located based on the JNDI name used with the annotation (either
defaulted or provided explicitly).

[#50561028_pgfId-1635746]##The type specified in the deployment
descriptor via the _remote_ , _local_ , _remote-home_ , or _local-home_

[#50561028_pgfId-1635752]##[#50561028_marker-1635750]##The Deployer is
responsible for the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322553]##The Deployer must ensure that all the
declared EJB references are bound to the business interfaces,
no-interface views, or home interfaces of enterprise beans that exist in
the operational environment. For session beans, the Deployer may use the
information provided by the Bean Provider in the mappedName element of
the _EJB_ annotation or the mapped-name element of the _ejb-ref_ or
_ejb-local-ref_ deployment descriptor element in creating this binding.
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_97191[See Access in the Global JNDI Namespace]
describes the syntax for session bean portable global JNDI names. The
Deployer may also use, for example, the [#50561028_marker-1503374]##JNDI
LinkRef mechanism to create a symbolic link to the actual JNDI name of
the target enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322554]##The Deployer must ensure that the target
enterprise bean is type-compatible with the types declared for the EJB
reference. This means that the target enterprise bean must be of the
type indicated by the use of the _EJB_ annotation, by the ejb-ref-type
element (if specified), and that the business interface, no-interface
view, and/or home and component interfaces of the target enterprise bean
must be Java type-compatible with the type of the injection target or
the types declared in the EJB reference.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322555]##If an _EJB_ annotation includes the
_beanName_ element or the _ejb-ref_ or _ejb-local-ref_ element includes
the [#50561028_marker-1503375]##ejb-link element, the Deployer should
bind the enterprise bean reference to the enterprise bean specified as
the target.

[#50561028_pgfId-1668513]##If an EJB annotation includes the lookup
element or the the _ejb-ref_ or _ejb-local-ref_ element includes the
_lookup-name_ element, the Deployer should bind the enterprise bean
reference to the enterprise bean specified as the target. It is an error
for an EJB reference declaration to include both an ejb-link and a
lookup-name element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1650566]##The following example illustrates the use of
the lookup-name element to bind an EJB reference to a target enterprise
bean in the operational environment. The reference was originally
declared in the bean’s code using an annotation. The target enterprise
bean has ejb-name ShoppingCart and is deployed in the stand-alone module

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1322564]##[#50561028_marker-1322563]##A resource
manager connection factory is an object that is used to create
connections to a resource manager. For example, an object that
implements the javax.sql.DataSource interface is a resource manager
connection factory for java.sql.Connection objects that implement
connections to a database management system.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322565]##This section describes the metadata
annotations and deployment descriptor elements that allow the enterprise
bean code to refer to resource factories using logical names called
r[#50561028_marker-1503377]##esource manager connection factory
references. The resource manager connection factory references are
special entries in the enterprise bean’s environment. The Deployer binds
the resource manager connection factory references to the actual
resource manager connection factories that are configured in the
container. Because these resource manager connection factories allow the
container to affect resource management, the connections acquired
through the resource manager connection factory references are called
[#50561028_marker-1503378]##managed resources (e.g., these resource
manager connection factories allow the container to implement connection
pooling and automatic enlistment of the connection with a transaction).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322567]##[#50561028_17903]##Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

[#50561028_pgfId-1603451]##This subsection describes the Bean Provider’s

responsibilities. The first subsection describes annotations for
injecting references to resource manager connection factories; the
second describes the API for accessing resource manager connection
references; and the third describes syntax for declaring the resource
manager connection references in a deployment descriptor.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1603463]##Injection of Resource Manager Connection Factory References

[#50561028_pgfId-1603467]##A field or a method of an enterprise bean may
be annotated with the _Resource_ annotation. The name and type of the
factory are as described above in link:Ejb.htm#50561028_18961[See
Annotations for Environment Entries]. The _authenticationType_ and
_shareable_ elements of the _Resource_ annotation may be used to control
the type of authentication desired for the resource and the shareability
of connections acquired from the factory, as described in the following
sections.

[#50561028_pgfId-1603470]##The following code example illustrates how an

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322569]##Programming Interfaces for Resource Manager Connection Factory References

[#50561028_pgfId-1322571]##[#50561028_marker-1322570]##The Bean Provider
must use resource manager connection factory references to obtain
connections to resources as follows.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322572]##Assign an entry in the enterprise bean’s
environment to the resource manager connection factory reference. (See
subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_23196[See Declaration of Resource
Manager Connection Factory References in Deployment Descriptor] for
information on how resource manager connection factory references are
declared in the deployment descriptor.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1322576]##The EJB specification recommends, but does
not require, that all resource manager connection factory references be
organized in the subcontexts of the bean’s environment, using a
different subcontext for each resource manager type. For example, all
JDBC data source references might be declared in the java:comp/env/jdbc
subcontext, and all JMS connection factories in the java:comp/env/jms
subcontext. Also, all JavaMail connection factories might be declared in
the _java:comp/env/mail_ subcontext and all URL connection factories in
the _java:comp/env/url_ subcontext. Note that resource manager
connection factory references declared via annotations will not, by
default, appear in any subcontext.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322577]##Lookup the resource manager connection
factory object in the enterprise bean’s environment using the EJBContext
_lookup_ method or using the JNDI API.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322578]##Invoke the appropriate method on the resource
manager connection factory to obtain a connection to the resource. The
factory method is specific to the resource type. It is possible to
obtain multiple connections by calling the factory object multiple
times.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322579]##The Bean Provider can control the
shareability of the connections acquired from the resource manager
[#50561028_marker-1503381]##connection factory. By default, connections
to a [#50561028_marker-1503379]##resource manager are shareable across
other enterprise beans in the application that use the same resource in
the same transaction context. The Bean Provider can specify that
connections obtained from a resource manager connection factory
reference are not shareable by specifying the value of the _shareable_
annotation element to _false_ or the value of the _res-sharing-scope_
[#50561028_marker-1503380]## deployment descriptor element to be
_Unshareable_ . The sharing of connections to a resource manager allows
the container to optimize the use of connections and enables the
container’s use of local transaction optimizations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1426151]##The Bean Provider has two choices with
respect to dealing with associating a principal with the resource
manager access:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322580]##Allow the Deployer to set up
[#50561028_marker-1503382]##principal mapping or
[#50561028_marker-1503383]##resource manager sign-on information. In
this case, the enterprise bean code invokes a resource manager
connection factory method that has no security-related parameters.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322581]##Sign on to the resource manager from the bean
code. In this case, the enterprise bean invokes the appropriate resource
manager connection factory method that takes the sign-on information as
method parameters.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322583]##[#50561028_marker-1322582]##The Bean Provider
uses the _authenticationType_ annotation element or the res-auth
deployment descriptor element to indicate which of the two
[#50561028_marker-1503384]##resource manager authentication approaches
is used.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322584]##We expect that the first form (i.e., letting
the Deployer set up the resource manager sign-on information) will be
the approach used by most enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322641]##The Bean Provider must use the
[#50561028_marker-1503392]##javax.sql.DataSource
[#50561028_marker-1503399]##resource manager connection factory type for
obtaining [#50561028_marker-1503391]##JDBC connections, and the
[#50561028_marker-1503393]##javax.jms.ConnectionFactory,
javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory, or javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory
for obtaining [#50561028_marker-1503394]##JMS connections.

[#50561028_pgfId-1345841]##The Bean Provider must use the
_javax.mail.Session_ [#50561028_marker-1503395]## resource manager
connection factory type for obtaining
[#50561028_marker-1503396]##JavaMail connections, and the _java.net.URL_
[#50561028_marker-1503397]## resource manager connection factory type
for obtaining [#50561028_marker-1503398]##URL connections.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322642]##It is recommended that the Bean Provider
names JDBC data sources in the java:comp/env/jdbc subcontext, and JMS
connection factories in the java:comp/env/jms subcontext. It is also
recommended that the Bean Provider name all JavaMail connection
factories in the _java:comp/env/mail_ subcontext, and all URL connection
factories in the _java:comp/env/url_ subcontext. Note that resource
manager connection factory references declared via annotations will not,
by default, appear in any subcontext.

enterprise bean to use the API described in this section to obtain
resource objects that provide access to additional back-end systems.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322645]##[#50561028_16016]##Deployer’s Responsibility

[#50561028_pgfId-1322646]##The Deployer uses deployment tools to
[#50561028_marker-1503400]##bind the
[#50561028_marker-1503401]##resource manager connection factory
references to the actual resource factories configured in the target
operational environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322647]##The Deployer must perform the following tasks
for each resource manager connection factory reference declared in the
metadata annotations or deployment descriptor:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322648]##Bind the resource manager connection factory
reference to a resource manager connection factory that exists in the
operational environment. The Deployer may use, for example, the JNDI
LinkRef mechanism to create a symbolic link to the actual JNDI name of
the resource manager connection factory. The resource manager connection
factory type must be compatible with the type declared in the source
code or in the res-type element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322649]##Provide any additional configuration
information that the resource manager needs for opening and managing the
resource. The configuration mechanism is resource-manager specific, and
is beyond the scope of this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322650]##If the value of the _Resource_ annotation
_authenticationType_ element is _AuthenticationType.CONTAINER_ or the
deployment descriptor [#50561028_marker-1503402]##res-auth element is
Container, the Deployer is responsible for configuring the sign-on
information for the resource manager. This is performed in a manner
specific to the EJB container and resource manager; it is beyond the
scope of this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322651]##For example, if principals must be mapped
from the security domain and principal realm used at the enterprise
beans application level to the security domain and principal realm of
the resource manager, the Deployer or System Administrator must define
the mapping. The mapping is performed in a manner specific to the EJB
container and resource manager; it is beyond the scope of the current
EJB specification.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1322653]##[#50561028_26982]##Container Provider Responsibility

[#50561028_pgfId-1322654]##The [#50561028_marker-1503411]##EJB Container
Provider is responsible for the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322655]##Provide the
[#50561028_marker-1503407]##deployment tools that allow the Deployer to
perform the tasks described in the previous subsection.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322656]##Provide the implementation of the resource
manager connection factory classes for the resource managers that are
configured with the EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322657]##If the Bean Provider sets the
_authenticationType_ element of the _Resource_ annotation to
_AuthenticationType.APPLICATION_ or the res-auth deployment descriptor
entry for a resource manager connection factory reference to
Application, the container must allow the bean to perform explicit
programmatic sign-on using the resource manager’s API.

[#50561028_pgfId-1426160]##If the Bean Provider sets the _shareable_
element of the _Resource_ annotation to _false_ or sets the
_res-sharing-scope_ deployment descriptor entry for a resource manager
connection factory reference to _Unshareable_ , the container must not
attempt to share the connections obtained from the resource manager
connection factory _referencelink:#pgfId-1430594[106]_ . If the Bean
Provider sets the _res-sharing-scope_ of a resource manager connection
factory reference to _Shareable_ or does not specify _res-sharing-scope_
, the container must share the connections obtained from the resource
manager connection factory according to the requirements defined in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50453[See Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition
Specification Version 7 (Java EE).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1322658]##The container must provide tools that allow
the Deployer to set up [#50561028_marker-1503408]##resource manager
sign-on information for the resource manager references whose annotation
element _authenticationType_ is set to _AuthenticationType.CONTAINER_ or
whose [#50561028_marker-1503409]##res-auth deployment descriptor element
element is set to Container. The minimum requirement is that the
Deployer must be able to specify the user/password information for each
resource manager connection factory reference declared by the enterprise
bean, and the container must be able to use the user/password
combination for user authentication when obtaining a connection to the
resource by invoking the resource manager connection factory.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322659]##Although not required by the EJB
specification, we expect that containers will support some form of a
[#50561028_marker-1503410]##single sign-on mechanism that spans the
application server and the resource managers. The container will allow
the Deployer to set up the resource managers such that the EJB caller
principal can be propagated (directly or through principal mapping) to a
resource manager, if required by the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322660]##While not required by the EJB specification,
most EJB Container Providers also provide the following features:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322661]##A tool to allow the System Administrator to
add, remove, and configure a resource manager for the EJB server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1677100]##A mechanism to pool connections to the
resources for the enterprise beans and otherwise manage the use of
resources by the container. The pooling must be transparent to the
enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1677103]##The [#50561028_marker-1677102]##System
Administrator is typically responsible for the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1322665]##Add, remove, and configure resource managers
in the EJB server environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1322666]##In some scenarios, these tasks can be

shareable and do not require authentication. The use of the _Resource_
annotation to declare a resource environment reference differs from the
use of the _Resource_ annotation to declare simple environment

not one of the Java language types used for simple environment
references.

destination, or to specify whether the destination is used to produce or
consume messages. The deployment descriptor entries described in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_38869[See Declaration of Message Destination
References in Deployment Descriptor] provide a way to associate multiple
message destination references with a single message destination and to
specify whether each message destination reference is used to produce,
consume, or both produce and consume messsages, so that the entire
message flow of an application may be specified. The Application
Assembler may use these message destination links to link together
message destination references that have been declared using the
_Resource_ annotation. A message destination reference declared via the
_Resource_ annotation is assumed to be used to both produce and consume
messages; this default may be overridden using a deployment descriptor
entry.

the _message-destination-type_ defaults to the type of the injection
target.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560393]##The Application Assembler specifies the link
between message consumers and producers as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1560394]##The Application Assembler uses the
_message-destination_ element to specify a logical message destination
within the application. The _message-destination_ element defines a
_message-destination-name_ , which is used for the purpose of linking.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560472]##The Application Assembler uses the
message-destination-link element of the message-destination-ref element
of an enterprise bean that produces messages to link it to the target
destination. The value of the message-destination-link element is the
name of the target destination, as defined in the
_message-destination-name_ element of the _message-destination_ element.
The _message-destination_ element can be in any module in the same Java
EE application as the referencing component. The Application Assembler
uses the _message-destination-usage_ element of the
_message-destination-ref_ element to indicate that the referencing
enterprise bean produces messages to the referenced destination.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560395]##If the consumer of messages from the common
destination is a message-driven bean, the Application Assembler uses the
_message-destination-link_ element of the _message-driven_ element to
reference the logical destination. If the Application Assembler links a
message-driven bean to its source destination, he or she should use the
_message-destination-type_ element of the _message-driven_ element to
specify the expected destination type.

[#50561028_pgfId-1577837]##If an enterprise bean is otherwise a message
consumer, the Application Assembler uses the message-destination-link
element of the message-destination-ref element of the enterprise bean
that consumes messages to link to the common destination. In the latter
case, the Application Assembler uses the _message-destination-usage_
element of the _message-destination-ref_ element to indicate that the
enterprise bean consumes messages from the referenced destination.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560509]##To avoid the need to rename message
destinations to have unique names within an entire Java EE application,
the Application Assembler may use the following syntax in the
_message-destination-link_ element of the referencing application
component. The Application Assembler specifies the path name of the
ejb-jar file containing the referenced message destination and appends
the _message-destination-name_ of the target destination separated from
the path name by _#_ . The path name is relative to the referencing
application component jar file. In this manner, multiple destinations
with the same _message-destination-name_ may be uniquely identified.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560396]##When linking message destinations, the
Application Assembler must ensure that the consumers and producers for
the destination require a message destination of the same or compatible
type, as determined by the messaging system.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560397]##The following example illustrates the use of
message destination linking in the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1560246]##The Deployer must ensure that all the

annotations and deployment descriptor elements that allow the enterprise
bean code to refer to the entity manager factory for a persistence unit
using a logical name called a _persistence unit reference_ . Persistence
unit references are special entries in the enterprise bean’s

contexts of the specified type and configured in accordance with their
persistence unit, as described in the _Java Persistence API_

view of locating container-managed entity managers and defines his or
her responsibilities. The first subsection describes annotations for
injecting references to container-managed entity managers; the second
describes the API for accessing references to container-managed entity
managers; and the third describes syntax for declaring these references
in a deployment descriptor.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1625359]##Injection of Persistence Context References

[#50561028_pgfId-1625360]##A field or a method of an enterprise bean may
be annotated with the _PersistenceContext_ annotation. The _name_
element specifies the name under which a container-managed entity
manager for the referenced persistence unit may be located in the JNDI
naming context. The optional _unitName_ element specifies the name of
the persistence unit as declared in the _persistence.xml_ file that
defines the persistence unit. The optional _type_ element specifies
whether a transaction-scoped or extended persistence context is to be
used. If the type is not specified, a transaction-scoped persistence
context will be used. References to container-managed entity managers
with extended persistence contexts can only be injected into stateful
session beans. The optional _properties_ element specifies configuration
properties to be passed to the persistence provider when the entity
manager is created.

[#50561028_pgfId-1625428]##Although a persistence context reference is
an entry in the enterprise bean’s environment, the Bean Provider must
not use an [#50561028_marker-1625429]##env-entry element to declare it.

[#50561028_pgfId-1625430]##Instead, if metadata annotations are not
used, the Bean Provider must declare all the persistence context
references in the deployment descriptor using the
persistence-context-ref elements. This allows the ejb-jar consumer (i.e.
Application Assembler or Deployer) to discover all the persistence
context references used by an enterprise bean. Deployment descriptor
entries may also be used to specify injection of a persistence context
reference into a bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1625432]##[#50561028_marker-1625431]##[#50561028_marker-1625433]##Each

entity manager reference. The persistence-context-ref element consists
of the optional description, persistence-unit-name,
_persistence-context-type,_ persistence-context-synchronization, and
_persistence-property_ elements, and the mandatory
persistence-context-ref-name element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1625434]##The persistence-context-ref-name element
contains the name of the environment entry used in the enterprise bean’s
code. The name of the environment entry is relative to the java:comp/env
context (e.g., the name should be persistence/InventoryAppMgr rather
than java:comp/env/persistence/InventoryAppMgr). The
persistence-unit-name element is the name of the persistence unit, as
specified in the _persistence.xml_ file for the persistence unit. The
_persistence-context-type_ element specifies whether a
transaction-scoped or extended persistence context is to be used. Its
value is either _Transaction_ or _Extended_ . If the persistence context
type is not specified, a transaction-scoped persistence context will be
used. The optional persistence-context-synchronization element specifies
whether the persistence context is automatically synchronized with the
current transaction. Its value is either Synchronized or Unsynchronized.
If the persistence context synchronization is not specified, the
persistence context will be automatically synchronized. The optional
_persistence-property_ elements specify configuration properties that
are passed to the persistence provider when the entity manager is
created.

=== [#50561028_pgfId-1642332]##[#50561028_87405]##Security Management

[#50561028_pgfId-1642333]##This chapter defines the EJB architecture’s
support for security management.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1642334]##Overview

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1627424]##We set the following goals for the security
management in the EJB architecture:

[#50561028_pgfId-1627425]##Lessen the burden of the application
developer (i.e. the Bean Provider) for securing the application by
allowing greater coverage from more qualified EJB roles. The EJB
Container Provider provides the implementation of the security
infrastructure; the Deployer and System Administrator define the
security policies.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627426]##Allow the security policies to be set by the
Application Assembler or Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627427]##Allow the enterprise bean applications to be
portable across multiple EJB servers that use different security
mechanisms.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627428]##The EJB architecture encourages the Bean
Provider to implement the enterprise bean class without hard-coding the
security policies and mechanisms into the business methods. In most
cases, the enterprise bean’s business methods should not contain any
security-related logic. This allows the Deployer to configure the
security policies for the application in a way that is most appropriate
for the operational environment of the enterprise.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627430]##[#50561028_marker-1627429]##To make the
Deployer’s task easier, the Bean Provider or the Application Assembler
(which could be the same party as the Bean Provider) may define security
roles for an application composed of one or more enterprise beans. A
security role is a semantic grouping of permissions that a given type of
users of the application must have in order to successfully use the
application. The Bean Provider can define declaratively using metadata
annotations or the deployment descriptor the method permissions for each
security role. The Applications Assembler can define, augment, or
override the method permissions using the deployment descriptor. A
method permission is a permission to invoke a specified group of methods
of an enterprise bean’s business interface, no-interface view, home
interface, component interface, and/or web service endpoint. The
security roles defined by the Bean Provider or the Application Assembler
present a simplified security view of the enterprise beans application
to the Deployer—the Deployer’s view of the application’s security
requirements is the small set of security roles rather than a large
number of individual methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627432]##[#50561028_marker-1627431]##The security
principal under which a method invocation is performed is typically that
of the component’s caller. By specifying a run-as identity, however, it
is possible to specify that a different principal be substituted for the
execution of the methods of the bean’s business interface, no-interface
view, home interface, component interface, and/or web service endpoint
and any methods of other enterprise beans that the bean may call.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627433]##This determines whether the caller principal
is propagated from the caller to the callee—that is, whether the called
enterprise bean will see the same returned value of the
EJBContext.getCallerPrincipal as the calling enterprise bean—or whether
a security principal that has been assigned to the specified security
role will be used for the execution of the bean’s methods and will be
visible as the caller principal in the bean’s callee.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627434]##The Bean Provider can use metadata
annotations or the deployment descriptor to specify whether the caller’s
security identity or a run-as security identity should be used for the
execution of the bean’s methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627435]##By default, the caller principal will be
propagated as the caller identity. The Bean Provider can use the _RunAs_
annotation to specify that a security principal that has been assigned
to a specified security role be used instead. See Section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_99952[See Specification of Security Identities in
the Deployment Descriptor].

[#50561028_pgfId-1627439]##If the deployment descriptor is used to
specify the security principal, the Bean Provider or the Application
Assembler can use the _security-identity_ deployment descriptor element
to specify the security identity. If the _security-identity_ deployment
descriptor element is not specified and if a run-as identity has not
been specified by the use of the _RunAs_ annotation or if
_use-caller-identity_ is specified as the value of the
_security-identity_ element, the caller principal is propagated from the
caller to the callee. If the _run-as_ element is specified, a security
principal that has been assigned to the specified security role will be
used. The Application Assembler is permitted to override a security
identity value set or defaulted by the Bean Provider.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627440]##The Deployer is responsible for assigning
principals, or groups of principals, which are defined in the target
operational environment, to the security roles defined by the Bean
Provider or Application Assembler. The Deployer is also responsible for
assigning principals for the run-as identities specified. The Deployer
is further responsible for configuring other aspects of the security
management of the enterprise beans, such as principal mapping for
inter-enterprise bean calls, and [#50561028_marker-1627441]##principal
mapping for resource manager access.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627442]##At runtime, a client will be allowed to
invoke a business method only if the principal associated with the
client call has been assigned by the Deployer to have at least one
security role that is allowed to invoke the business method or if the
Bean Provider or Application Assembler has specified that security
authorization is not to be checked for the method (i.e., that all roles,
including any unauthenticated roles, are permitted). See
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_13312[See Method Permissions].

[#50561028_pgfId-1627446]##The Container Provider is responsible for
enforcing the security policies at runtime, providing the tools for
managing security at runtime, and providing the tools used by the
Deployer to manage security during deployment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627447]##Because not all security policies can be
expressed declaratively, the EJB architecture provides a simple
programmatic interface that the Bean Provider may use to access the
security context from the business methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627448]##The following sections define the
responsibilities of the individual EJB roles with respect to security
management.

perspective of the EJB architecture support for security, and defines
his or her responsibilities. In addition, the Bean Provider may define
the security roles for the application, as defined in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_28794[See Responsibilities of the Bean Provider
and/or Application Assembler].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627455]##Invocation of Other Enterprise Beans

[#50561028_pgfId-1627456]##An enterprise bean business method can invoke
another enterprise bean via the other bean’s business interface,
no-interface view, or home or component interface. The EJB architecture
provides no programmatic interfaces for the invoking enterprise bean to
control the principal passed to the invoked enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627458]##[#50561028_marker-1627457]##[#50561028_marker-1627459]##The
management of [#50561028_marker-1627460]##caller principals passed on
_inter-enterprise_ bean invocations (i.e. principal delegation) is set
up by the Deployer and System Administrator in a container-specific way.
The Bean Provider and Application Assembler should describe all the
requirements for the caller’s principal management of inter-enterprise
bean invocations as part of the description.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627461]##Resource Access

[#50561028_pgfId-1627465]##Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_11574[See
Resource Manager Connection Factory References] defines the protocol for
accessing resource managers, including the requirements for security
management.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627466]##Access of Underlying OS Resources

[#50561028_pgfId-1627468]##The EJB architecture does not define the
[#50561028_marker-1627467]##operating system principal under which
enterprise bean methods execute. Therefore, the Bean Provider cannot
rely on a specific principal for accessing the underlying OS resources,
such as files. (See Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_14232[See System
Principal] for the reasons behind this rule.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1627472]##We believe that most enterprise business
applications store information in resource managers such as relational
databases rather than in resources at the operating system levels.
Therefore, this rule should not affect the portability of most
enterprise beans.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627473]##Programming Style Recommendations

[#50561028_pgfId-1627475]##[#50561028_marker-1627474]##The Bean Provider
should neither implement security mechanisms nor hard-code security
policies in the enterprise beans’ business methods. Rather, the Bean
Provider should rely on the security mechanisms provided by the EJB
container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627476]##The Bean Provider can use metadata
annotations and/or the deployment descriptor to convey security-related
information to the Deployer. The information helps the Deployer to set
up the appropriate security policy for the enterprise bean application.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627477]##Programmatic Access to Caller’s Security Context

[#50561028_pgfId-1627478]##Note: In general, security management should
be enforced by the container in a manner that is transparent to the
enterprise beans’ business methods. The security API described in this
section should be used only in the less frequent situations in which the
enterprise bean business methods need to access the security context
information.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627530]##Use of getCallerPrincipal

[#50561028_pgfId-1627531]##The purpose of the _getCallerPrincipal_
method is to allow the enterprise bean methods to obtain the current
caller principal’s name. The methods might, for example, use the name as
a key to information in a database.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627533]##[#50561028_marker-1627532]##An enterprise
bean can invoke the getCallerPrincipal method to obtain a
java.security.Principal interface representing the current caller. The
enterprise bean can then obtain the distinguished name of the caller
principal using the getName method of the java.security.Principal
interface. If the security identity has not been established,
_getCallerPrincipal_ returns the container’s representation of the
unauthenticated identity.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627535]##[#50561028_marker-1627534]##Note that
getCallerPrincipal returns the principal that represents the caller of
the enterprise bean, not the principal that corresponds to the run-as
security identity for the bean, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627537]##The meaning of the current caller, the Java
class that implements the
[#50561028_marker-1627536]##java.security.Principal interface, and the
realm of the principals returned by the getCallerPrincipal method depend
on the operational environment and the configuration of the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627538]##An enterprise may have a complex security
infrastructure that includes multiple security domains. The security
infrastructure may perform one or more mapping of principals on the path
from an EJB caller to the EJB object. For example, an employee accessing
his or her company over the Internet may be identified by a userid and
password (basic authentication), and the security infrastructure may
authenticate the principal and then map the principal to a Kerberos
principal that is used on the enterprise’s intranet before delivering
the method invocation to the EJB object. If the security infrastructure
performs principal mapping, the _getCallerPrincipal_ method returns the
principal that is the result of the mapping, not the original caller
principal. (In the previous example, _getCallerPrincipal_ would return
the Kerberos principal.) The management of the security infrastructure,
such as principal mapping, is performed by the System Administrator
role; it is beyond the scope of the EJB specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627539]##The following code sample illustrates the use
of the getCallerPrincipal() method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627540]##

[#50561028_pgfId-1627564]##}

[#50561028_pgfId-1627565]##In the previous example, the enterprise bean
obtains the principal name of the current caller and uses it as the
primary key to locate an _EmployeeRecord_ entity. This example assumes
that application has been deployed such that the current caller
principal contains the primary key used for the identification of
employees (e.g., employee number).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627566]##Use of isCallerInRole

[#50561028_pgfId-1627567]##The main purpose of the
_isCallerInRole(String_ _roleName)_ method is to allow the Bean Provider
to code the security checks that cannot be easily defined declaratively
in the deployment descriptor using method permissions. Such a check
might impose a role-based limit on a request, or it might depend on
information stored in the database.

[#50561028_pgfId-1726796]##[#50561028_marker-1726794]##The enterprise
bean code can use the isCallerInRole method to test whether the current
caller has been assigned to a given security role. Security roles are
defined by the Container, Bean Provider or the Application Assembler
(see Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42520[See Security Roles]), and
are assigned to principals or principal groups that exist in the
operational environment by the Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727658]##The enterprise bean code can also use the
isCallerInRole method to test whether the current caller has been
authenticated; and without further consideration of whether the
authenticated caller has been assigned to one or more specific security
roles. To perform this test, the code passes the value “**” as the
argument to the isCallerInRole method. As is the case with all calls to
the isCallerInRole method, the run-time return value of the call will
depend on the security role linked to the reference (as defined in
section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_75382[See Linking Security Role References
to Security Roles]) and on the principal-to-role mapping configured for
the linked role (as defined in section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_49202[See
Assignment of Security Roles]).

[#50561028_pgfId-1726800]##Note that isCallerInRole(String roleName)
tests the principal that represents the caller of the enterprise bean,
not the principal that corresponds to the run-as security identity for
the bean, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627574]##The following code sample illustrates the use

[#50561028_pgfId-1729975]##[#50561028_marker-1627594]##The Bean Provider
is responsible for declaring all names that may be used to reference
security roles from the enterprise bean code. The names of security
roles defined in the deployment descriptor or used in the RolesAllowed
annotation are implicitly declared. The Bean Provider is responsible for
using either the _DeclareRoles_ annotation or the security-role-ref
elements of the deployment descriptor to declare all such names that are
not implicitly declared.

[#50561028_pgfId-1729963]##The _DeclareRoles_ annotation is specified on
a bean class, where it serves to declare the names of (otherwise
undeclared) roles that may be tested by calling _isCallerInRole_ from
within the methods of the annotated class. Declaring the security roles
allows the Bean Provider, Application Assembler, or Deployer to link
security role names used in the code to the security roles defined for
an assembled application. In the absence of this linking step, any
security role name as used in the code will be assumed to correspond to
a security role of the same name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627596]##When the Bean Provider uses the DeclareRoles
annotation to declare the name of a role used as a parameter to the
isCallerInRole(String roleName) method, the declared name must be the
same as the parameter value. The Bean Provider may optionally provide a
description of the named security roles in the description element of
the _DeclareRoles_ annotation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627650]##[#50561028_marker-1627649]##The Bean Provider
and Application Assembler (which could be the same party as the Bean
Provider) may define a security view of the enterprise beans contained
in the ejb-jar file. Providing the security view is optional for the
Bean Provider and Application Assembler.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627651]##The main reason for providing the security
view of the enterprise beans is to simplify the Deployer’s job. In the
absence of a security view of an application, the Deployer needs
detailed knowledge of the application in order to deploy the application
securely. For example, the Deployer would have to know what each
business method does to determine which users can call it. The security
view defined by the Bean Provider or Application Assembler presents a
more consolidated view to the Deployer, allowing the Deployer to be less
familiar with the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627653]##The security view consists of a set of
security roles. A [#50561028_marker-1627652]##security role is a
semantic grouping of permissions that a given type of users of an
application must have in order to successfully use the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627655]##[#50561028_marker-1627654]##The Bean Provider
or Application Assembler defines method permissions for each security
role. A [#50561028_marker-1627656]##method permission is a permission to
invoke a specified group of methods of the enterprise beans’ business
interface, no-interface view, home interface, component interface,
and/or web service endpoint.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627657]##It is important to keep in mind that the
security roles are used to define the logical security view of an
application. They should not be confused with the user groups, users,
principals, and other concepts that exist in the target enterprise’s
operational environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627658]##In special cases, a qualified Deployer may
change the definition of the security roles for an application, or
completely ignore them and secure the application using a different
mechanism that is specific to the operational environment.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627660]##[#50561028_42520]##Security Roles

[#50561028_pgfId-1627662]##[#50561028_marker-1627661]##The Bean Provider
or Application Assembler can define one or more security roles in the
bean’s metadata annotations or deployment descriptor. The Bean Provider
or Application Assembler then assigns groups of methods of the
enterprise beans’ business, home, and component interfaces, no-interface
view, and/or web service endpoints to the security roles to define the
security view of the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627663]##Because the Bean Provider and Application
Assembler do not, in general, know the security environment of the
operational environment, the security roles are meant to be logical
roles (or actors), each representing a type of user that should have the
same access rights to the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627664]##The Deployer then assigns user groups and/or
user accounts defined in the operational environment to the security
roles defined by the Bean Provider and Application Assembler.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727726]##A security role with the name “**” is defined
by the Container, and is intended to be used by the Bean Provider,
Application Assembler, or Deployer to indicate that the caller must log
on or authenticate to invoke a method or to perform some processing
requiring membership in this container role. This container security
role indicates that authentication, without consideration of role
membership, is required. An application role should not be defined with
the same name as this container security role, and a security role
reference should not be used to link this role reference to a different
role. Moreover the assignment of principals to the container role with
this name should not be subject to reconfiguration that would remove any
authenticated user from membership in the container role. That said,
when an application defines a security role in its deployment descriptor
with the name “**”, this application role is applied wherever the
application or its deployment descriptor refers to a role named “**”.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727739]##Defining the security roles in the metadata
annotations and/or deployment descriptor is
optionallink:#pgfId-1627667[107]. Their omission means that the Bean
Provider and Application Assembler chose not to pass any security
deployment related instructions to the Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627669]##If Java language metadata annotations are
used, the Bean Provider uses the _DeclareRoles_ and _RolesAllowed_
annotations to define the security roles. The set of security roles used
by the application is taken to be the aggregation of the security roles
defined by the security role names used in the _DeclareRoles_ and
_RolesAllowed_ annotations. The Bean Provider may augment the set of
security roles defined for the application by annotations in this way by
means of the _security-role_ deployment descriptor element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627671]##If the deployment descriptor is used, the
Bean Provider and/or Application Assembler uses the _security-role_
deployment descriptor element as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1727776]##Define each security role using a
[#50561028_marker-1627672]##security-role element. An application
security role with name “**” should not be defined as the Container must
provide a container security role with this name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627674]##Use the role-name element to define the name
of the security role.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627675]##Optionally, use the description element to

[#50561028_pgfId-1627722]##If the Bean Provider and/or Application
Assembler have defined security roles for the enterprise beans in the
ejb-jar file, they can also specify the methods of the business, home,
and component interfaces, no-interface views, and/or web service
endpoints that each security role is allowed to invoke.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627723]##Metadata annotations and/or the deployment
descriptor can be used for this purpose.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627724]##Method permissions are defined as a binary
relation from the set of security roles to the set of methods of the
business interfaces, home interfaces, component interfaces, no-interface
views, and/or web service endpoints of session and
entitylink:#pgfId-1717590[108] beans, including all their
superinterfaces (including the methods of the EJBHome and EJBObject
interfaces and/or EJBLocalHome and EJBLocalObject interfaces). The
method permissions relation includes the pair (R, M) if and only if the
security role R is allowed to invoke the method M.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627725]##Specification of Method Permissions with Metadata Annotations

[#50561028_pgfId-1627726]##The following is the description of the rules
for the specification of method permissions using Java language metadata
annotations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627727]##The method permissions for the methods of a
bean class may be specified on the class, the business methods of the
class, or both.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627728]##The _RolesAllowed_ , _PermitAll_ , and
_DenyAll_ annotations are used to specify method permissions. The value
of the _RolesAllowed_ annotation is a list of security role names to be
mapped to the security roles that are permitted to execute the specified
method(s). The _PermitAll_ annotation specifies that all security roles,
including any unauthenticated roles, are permitted to execute the
specified method(s). The _DenyAll_ annotation specifies that no security
roles, including any unauthenticated roles, are permitted to execute the
specified method(s).

[#50561028_pgfId-1627729]##Specifying the _RolesAllowed_ or _PermitAll_
or DenyAll annotation on the bean class means that it applies to all
applicable business methods of the class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627730]##Method permissions may be specified on a
method of the bean class to override the method permissions value
specified on the bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627731]##If the bean class has superclasses, the
following additional rules apply.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627732]##A method permissions value specified on a
superclass _S_ applies to the business methods defined by _S_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1627733]##A method permissions value may be specified
on a business method _M_ defined by class _S_ to override for method _M_
the method permissions value explicitly or implicitly specified on the
class _S_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1627734]##If a method _M_ of class _S_ overrides a
business method defined by a superclass of _S_ , the method permissions
value of _M_ is determined by the above rules as applied to class _S_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1627735]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1627736]##Example:

[#50561028_pgfId-1627737]##@RolesAllowed("admin")

[#50561028_pgfId-1627738]##public class SomeClass \{

[#50561028_pgfId-1627739]## public void aMethod () \{...}

[#50561028_pgfId-1627740]## public void bMethod () \{...}

[#50561028_pgfId-1627751]##}

[#50561028_pgfId-1627752]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1627753]##Assuming _aMethod_ , _bMethod_ , _cMethod_
are methods of business interface _A_ , the method permissions values of
methods _aMethod_ and _bMethod_ are _RolesAllowed(_ " _HR_ " _)_ and

Unspecified Method Permissions]) .

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627758]##[#50561028_81792]##Specification of Method Permissions in the Deployment Descriptor

[#50561028_pgfId-1627759]##The Bean Provider may use the deployment
descriptor as an alternative to metadata annotations to specify the
method permissions (or as a means to supplement or override metadata
annotations for method permission values). The Application Assembler is
permitted to override the method permission values using the bean’s
deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627760]##Any values explicitly specified in the
deployment descriptor override any values specified in annotations. If a
value for a method has not be specified in the deployment descriptor,
and a value has been specified for that method by means of the use of
annotations, the value specified in annotations will apply. The
granularity of overriding is on the per-method basis.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627762]##[#50561028_marker-1627761]##The Bean Provider
or Application Assembler defines the method permissions relation in the
deployment descriptor using the method-permission elements as follows.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627763]##Each method-permission element includes a
list of one or more security roles and a list of one or more methods.
All the listed security roles are allowed to invoke all the listed
methods. Each security role in the list is identified by the role-name
element, and each method (or a set of methods, as described below) is
identified by the method element. An optional description can be
associated with a method-permission element using the description
element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727787]##If the role name “**” is included in the list
of allowed roles, and the application has not defined in its deployment
descriptor an application security role with this name, then the list of
allowed roles includes every and any authenticated user.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627764]##The method permissions relation is defined as
the union of all the method permissions defined in the individual
method-permission elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730110]##A security role or a method may appear in
multiple method-permission elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730111]##The Bean Provider or Application Assembler
can indicate that all roles, including any unauthenticated roles, are
permitted to execute one or more specified methods (i.e., the methods
should not be “checked” for authorization prior to invocation by the
container). The _unchecked_ element is used instead of a role name in
the _method-permission_ element to indicate that all roles, including
any unauthenticated roles, are permitted.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627767]##If the method permission relation specifies
both the _unchecked_ element for a given method and one or more security
roles, all roles are permitted for the specified methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627769]##The _exclude-list_
[#50561028_marker-1627768]## element can be used to indicate the set of
methods that should not be called. The Deployer should configure the
enterprise bean’s security such that no access is permitted to any
method contained in the _exclude-list_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1627770]##If a given method is specified both in the
_exclude-list_ element and in the method permission relation, the
Deployer should configure the enterprise bean’s security such that no
access is permitted to the method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627772]##The [#50561028_marker-1627771]##method
element uses the ejb-name, method-name, and method-params elements to
denote one or more methods of an enterprise bean’s business interface,
home interface, component interface, no-interface view, and/or web
service endpoint. There are three legal styles for composing the method
element:

[#50561028_pgfId-1627773]## +
<method> +
<ejb-name>EJBNAME</ejb-name> +
<method-name>*</method-name> +
</method> +
 +
This style is used for referring to all of the methods of the business,
home, and component interfaces, no-interface view, and web service
endpoint of a specified enterprise bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627774]## +
<method> +
<ejb-name>EJBNAME</ejb-name> +
<method-name>METHOD</method-name> +
</method> +
 +
This style is used for referring to a specified method of the business,
home, or component interface, no-interface view, or web service endpoint
of the specified enterprise bean. If there are multiple methods with the
same overloaded name, this style refers to all of the overloaded
methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627775]## +
<method> +
<ejb-name>EJBNAME</ejb-name> +
<method-name>METHOD</method-name> +
<method-params> +
<method-param>PARAMETER_1</method-param> +
... +
<method-param>PARAMETER_N</method-param> +
</method-params> +
</method> +
 +
This style is used to refer to a specified method within a set of
methods with an overloaded name. The method must be defined in the
specified enterprise bean’s business, home, or component interface,
no-interface view, or web service endpoint. If there are multiple
methods with the same overloaded name, however, this style refers to all
of the overloaded methods.

[#50561028_pgfId-1698478]##The optional _method-intf_ element can be
used to differentiate between methods with the same name and signature
that are multiply defined across the business, component, or home
interfaces, no-interface view, and/or web service endpoint. If the same
method is a method of a local business interface, local component
interface, or no-interface view, the same method permission values apply
to the method for all of them. Likewise, if the same method is a method
of both the remote business interface and remote component interface,
the same method permission values apply to the method for both
interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627777]##The following example illustrates how
security roles are assigned method permissions in the deployment
descriptor:

[#50561028_pgfId-1727801]##The application's references to security
roles are linked to the security roles defined for the application. In
the absence of any explicit linking, a security role reference will be
linked to a security role having the same name. This requirement also
applies to role references with value “**”, and an explicit mapping
should only be defined for a role reference with value “**” when the
reference needs to be linked to an application role with name other than
“**”.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730026]##The Application Assembler uses a
security-role-ref element to explicitly link a role reference by a
component to a security role defined by annotation and/or by
security-role element (as described in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42520[See Security Roles]). The linkage is made
explicit using the role-link element of the security-role-ref element;
in which case the value of the role-link element must be the name of one
of the security roles defined by annotation and/or security-role
element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1730053]##A security-role-ref element need not be
defined for a role reference that is to be mapped to a security-role
with the same name as the role reference, and when a role-link is not
specified within a security-role-ref, the reference is implicitly mapped
to the security role with the same name as the reference.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627874]##By default the caller’s security identity is
used. The Bean Provider can use the _RunAs_ metadata annotation to
specify a run-as identity for the execution of the bean’s methods. If

internal methods of the bean that they might in turn call.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627881]## _Establishing a run-as identity for an
enterprise bean does not affect the identities of its callers, which are
the identities tested for permission to access the methods of the
enterprise bean. The run-as identity establishes the identity the
enterprise bean will use when it makes calls._

[#50561028_pgfId-1627882]##Because the Bean Provider and Application
Assembler do not, in general, know the security environment of the
operational environment, the run-as identity is designated by a
_logical_ role-name, which corresponds to one of the security roles
defined by the Bean Provider or Application Assembler in the metadata
annotations or deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627883]##The Deployer then assigns a security
principal defined in the operational environment to be used as the
principal for the run-as identity. The security principal assigned by

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1627914]##[#50561028_30939]##Deployer’s Responsibilities

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1627915]##The Deployer is responsible for ensuring that
an assembled application is secure after it has been deployed in the
target operational environment. This section defines the Deployer’s
responsibility with respect to EJB security management.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627916]##The Deployer uses deployment tools provided
by the EJB Container Provider to read the security view of the
application supplied by the Bean Provider and/or Application Assembler
in the metadata annotations and/or deployment descriptor. The Deployer’s
job is to map the security view that was specified by the Bean Provider
and/or Application Assembler to the mechanisms and policies used by the
security domain in the target operational environment. The output of the
Deployer’s work includes an application security policy descriptor that
is specific to the operational environment. The format of this
descriptor and the information stored in the descriptor are specific to
the EJB container.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627917]##The following subsections describe the
security related tasks performed by the Deployer.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627918]##Security Domain and Principal Realm Assignment

[#50561028_pgfId-1627920]##[#50561028_marker-1627919]##The Deployer is
responsible for assigning the security domain and principal realm to an
enterprise bean application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627921]##Multiple principal realms within the same
security domain may exist, for example, to separate the realms of
employees, trading partners, and customers. Multiple security domains
may exist, for example, in application hosting scenarios.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627922]##[#50561028_49202]##Assignment of Security Roles

[#50561028_pgfId-1627923]##The Deployer assigns principals and/or groups
of principals (such as individual users or user groups) used for
managing security in the operational environment to the security roles
defined by means of the _DeclareRoles_ and _RolesAllowed_ metadata
annotations and/or security-role elements of the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727845]##The Deployer does not define (or in effect
redefine) the principals assigned to the container security role with
name “**”. The Container is required to assign a principal of any and
every authenticated user (as defined by the operational environment of
the application) to the container security role with this name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1727851]##The Deployer does not assign principals
and/or principal groups to the security role references—the principals
and/or principals groups assigned to a security role apply also to all
the linked security role references. For example, the Deployer of the
AardvarkPayroll enterprise bean in subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_75382[See Linking Security Role References to
Security Roles] would assign principals and/or principal groups to the
security-role payroll-department, and the assigned principals and/or
principal groups would be implicitly assigned also to the linked
security role reference payroll.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627928]##The EJB architecture does not specify how an
enterprise should implement its security architecture. Therefore, the
process of assigning the logical security roles defined in the
application’s deployment descriptor to the operational environment’s
security concepts is specific to that operational environment.
Typically, the deployment process consists of assigning to each security
role one or more user groups (or individual users) defined in the
operational environment. This assignment is done on a per-application
basis. (That is, if multiple independent ejb-jar files use the same
security role name, each may be assigned differently.) If the Deployer
does not assign the logical security roles defined by the application to
groups in the operational environment, it must be assumed that a logical
role maps to a principal or principal group of the same name.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627930]##Principal Delegation

[#50561028_pgfId-1627932]##[#50561028_marker-1627931]##The Deployer is
responsible for configuring the principal delegation for inter-component
calls. The Deployer must follow any instructions supplied by the Bean
Provider and/or Application Assembler (for example, provided in the
_RunAs_ metadata annotations, the _run-as_ [#50561028_marker-1627933]##
elements of the deployment descriptor, in the description elements of
the annotations or deployment descriptor, or in a deployment manual).

[#50561028_pgfId-1627934]##If the security identity is defaulted, or it
is explicitly specified that the caller identity be used (e.g.,
_use-caller-identity_ [#50561028_marker-1627935]## deployment descriptor
element is specified), the caller principal is propagated from one
component to another (i.e., the caller principal of the first enterprise
bean in a call-chain is passed to the enterprise beans down the chain).

[#50561028_pgfId-1627936]##If the Bean Provider or Application Assembler
specifies that a run-as identity be used on behalf of a particular
enterprise bean, the Deployer must configure the enterprise beans such
that the run-as principal is used as the caller principal on any calls
that the enterprise bean makes to other beans, and that the run-as
principal is propagated along the call-chain of those other beans (in
the absence of the specification of any further run-as elements).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627937]##Security Management of Resource Access

[#50561028_pgfId-1627938]##The Deployer’s responsibilities with respect
to securing resource managers access are defined in subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_16016[See Deployer’s Responsibility].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627942]##General Notes on Deployment Descriptor Processing

[#50561028_pgfId-1627944]##[#50561028_marker-1627943]##The Deployer can
use the security view defined in the deployment descriptor by the Bean
Provider and Application Assembler merely as “hints” and may change the
information whenever necessary to adapt the security policy to the
operational environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627945]##Since providing the security information is
optional for the Bean Provider and Application Assembler, the Deployer
is responsible for performing any tasks that have not been done by the
Bean Provider or Application Assembler. (For example, if the definition
of security roles and method permissions is missing in the metadata
annotations and in deployment descriptor, the Deployer must define the
security roles and method permissions for the application.) It is not
required that the Deployer store the output of this activity in the
standard ejb-jar file format.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1627947]##EJB Client Responsibilities

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1627949]##[#50561028_marker-1627948]##This section
defines the rules that the EJB client program must follow to ensure that
the security context passed on the client calls, and possibly imported
by the enterprise bean, do not conflict with the EJB server’s
capabilities for association between a security context and
transactions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627950]##These rules are:

[#50561028_pgfId-1627952]##A [#50561028_marker-1627951]##transactional
client cannot change its principal association within a transaction.
This rule ensures that all calls from the client within a transaction
are performed with the same security context.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627953]##A session bean’s client must not change its
principal association for the duration of the communication with the
session object. This rule ensures that the server can associate a
[#50561028_marker-1627954]##security identity with the session instance
at instance creation time, and never have to change the security
association during the session instance lifetime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627955]##If transactional requests within a single
transaction arrive from multiple clients (this could happen if there are
intermediary objects or programs in the transaction call-chain), all
requests within the same transaction must be associated with the same
[#50561028_marker-1627956]##security context.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1627958]##EJB Container Provider’s Responsibilities

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1627959]##This section describes the responsibilities
of the EJB Container Provider and Server Provider.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627960]##Deployment Tools

[#50561028_pgfId-1627961]##The EJB Container Provider is responsible for
providing the deployment tools that the Deployer can use to perform the
tasks defined in Section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_30939[See Deployer’s
Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1627966]##[#50561028_marker-1627965]##The deployment
tools read the information from the beans’ metadata annotations and/or
deployment descriptor and present the information to the Deployer. The
tools guide the Deployer through the deployment process, and present him
or her with choices for mapping the security information in the metadata
annotations and deployment descriptor to the security management
mechanisms and policies used in the target operational environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627967]##The deployment tools’ output is stored in an
EJB container-specific manner, and is available at runtime to the EJB
container.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627968]##Security Domain(s)

[#50561028_pgfId-1627970]##[#50561028_marker-1627969]##The EJB container
provides a security domain and one or more principal realms to the
enterprise beans. The EJB architecture does not specify how an EJB
server should implement a security domain, and does not define the scope
of a security domain.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627971]##A security domain can be implemented,
managed, and administered by the EJB server. For example, the EJB server
may store X509 certificates or it might use an external security
provider such as Kerberos.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627972]##The EJB specification does not define the
scope of the security domain. For example, the scope may be defined by
the boundaries of the application, EJB server, operating system,
network, or enterprise.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627973]##The EJB server can, but is not required to,
provide support for multiple security domains, and/or multiple principal
realms.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627974]##The case of multiple domains on the same EJB
server can happen when a large server is used for application hosting.
Each hosted application can have its own security domain to ensure
security and management isolation between applications owned by multiple
organizations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627975]##Security Mechanisms

[#50561028_pgfId-1627977]##[#50561028_marker-1627976]##The EJB Container
Provider must provide the security mechanisms necessary to enforce the
security policies set by the Deployer. The EJB specification does not
specify the exact mechanisms that must be implemented and supported by
the EJB server.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627978]##The typical security functions provided by
the EJB server include:

[#50561028_pgfId-1627979]##Authentication of principals.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627980]##Access authorization for EJB calls and
resource manager access.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627981]##Secure communication with remote clients
(privacy, integrity, etc.).

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627982]##Passing Principals on EJB Calls

[#50561028_pgfId-1627983]##The EJB Container Provider is responsible for
providing the deployment tools that allow the Deployer to configure the
principal delegation for calls from one enterprise bean to another. The
EJB container is responsible for performing the principal delegation as
specified by the Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627985]##[#50561028_marker-1627984]##The EJB container
must be capable of allowing the Deployer to specify that, for all calls
from a single application within a single Java EE product, the caller
principal is propagated on calls from one enterprise bean to another
(i.e., the multiple beans in the call chain will see the same return
value from getCallerPrincipal).

[#50561028_pgfId-1627986]##This requirement is necessary for
applications that need a consistent return value of _getCallerPrincipal_
across a chain of calls between enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1627987]##The EJB container must be capable of allowing
the Deployer to specify that a run-as principal be used for the
execution of the business, home, and component interfaces, no-interface
view, and/or web service endpoint methods of a session or an
entitylink:#pgfId-1717597[109] bean, or for the message listener methods
of a message-driven bean.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1627988]##Security Methods in javax.ejb.EJBContext

[#50561028_pgfId-1627990]##[#50561028_marker-1627989]##The EJB container
must provide access to the caller’s security context information from
the enterprise beans’ instances via the getCallerPrincipal() and
isCallerInRole(String roleName) methods. The EJB container must provide
the caller’s security context information during the execution of a
business method invoked via the enterprise bean’s business, home,
component, no-interface view, or messsage listener interface, web
service endpoint, and/or _TimedObject_ interface, as defined in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_15928[See Operations Allowed in the Methods of a
Stateful Session Bean], link:Ejb.htm#50561028_35524[See Operations
Allowed in the Methods of a Stateless Session Bean],
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42676[See Operations Allowed in the Methods of a
Message-Driven Bean], link:../Optional/Chapters.htm#31076[], and
link:../Optional/Chapters.htm#22110[]. The container must ensure that
all enterprise bean method invocations received through these interfaces
are associated with some principal. If the security identity of the
caller has not been established, the container returns the container’s
representation of the unauthenticated identity. The container must never
return a null from the getCallerPrincipal method.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1628006]##Secure Access to Resource Managers

[#50561028_pgfId-1628008]##The EJB Container Provider is responsible for
providing [#50561028_marker-1628007]##secure access to resource managers
as described in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_26982[See Container
Provider Responsibility].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1628013]##[#50561028_marker-1628012]##Principal Mapping

[#50561028_pgfId-1628014]##If the application requires that its clients
are deployed in a different security domain, or if multiple applications
deployed across multiple security domains need to interoperate, the EJB
Container Provider is responsible for the mechanism and tools that allow
mapping of principals. The tools are used by the System Administrator to
configure the security for the application’s environment.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1628016]##[#50561028_14232]##System Principal

[#50561028_pgfId-1628018]##The EJB specification does not define the
“[#50561028_marker-1628017]##system” principal under which the JVM
running an enterprise bean’s method executes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628019]##Leaving the principal undefined makes it
easier for the EJB container vendors to provide runtime support for EJB
on top of their existing server infrastructures. For example, while one
EJB container implementation can execute all instances of all enterprise
beans in a single JVM, another implementation can use a separate JVM per
ejb-jar per client. Some EJB containers may make the system principal
the same as the application-level principal. Others may use different
principals, potentially from different principal realms and even
security domains.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1628021]##Runtime Security Enforcement

[#50561028_pgfId-1628023]##[#50561028_marker-1628022]##The EJB container
is responsible for enforcing the security policies defined by the
Deployer. The implementation of the enforcement mechanism is EJB
container implementation-specific. The EJB container may, but does not
have to, use the Java programming language security as the enforcement
mechanism.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628024]##For example, to isolate multiple executing
enterprise bean instances, the EJB container can load the multiple
instances into the same JVM and isolate them via using multiple class
loaders, or it can load each instance into its own JVM and rely on the
address space protection provided by the operating system.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628025]##The general security enforcement requirements
for the EJB container follow:

[#50561028_pgfId-1628026]##The EJB container must provide enforcement of
the client access control per the policy defined by the Deployer. A
caller is allowed to invoke a method if, and only if, the method is
specified as _PermitAll_ or the caller is assigned _at least one_ of the
security roles that includes the method in its method permissions
definition. (That is, it is not meant that the caller must be assigned
_all_ the roles associated with the method.) If the container denies a
client access to a business method, the container should throw the
_javax.ejb.EJBAccessExceptionlink:#pgfId-1628029[110]_ . If the EJB 2.1
client view is used, the container must throw the
[#50561028_marker-1628030]##java.rmi.RemoteException (or its subclass,
the _java.rmi.AccessException_ ) to the client if the client is a remote
client, or the _javax.ejb.EJBException_ [#50561028_marker-1628031]## (or
its subclass, the _javax.ejb.AccessLocalException_ ) if the client is a
local client.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628032]##The EJB container must isolate an enterprise
bean instance from other instances and other application components
running on the server. The EJB container must ensure that other
enterprise bean instances and other application components are allowed
to access an enterprise bean only via the enterprise bean’s business
interface, component interface, home interface, no-interface view,
and/or web service endpoint.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628033]##The EJB container must isolate an enterprise
bean instance at runtime such that the instance does not gain
unauthorized access to privileged system information. Such information
includes the internal implementation classes of the container, the
various runtime state and context maintained by the container, object
references of other enterprise bean instances, or resource managers used
by other enterprise bean instances. The EJB container must ensure that
the interactions between the enterprise beans and the container are only
through the EJB architected views.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628035]##The EJB container must ensure
the[#50561028_marker-1628034]## security of the persistent state of the
enterprise beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628036]##The EJB container must manage the mapping of
principals on calls to other enterprise beans or on access to resource
managers according to the security policy defined by the Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628037]##The container must allow the same enterprise
bean to be deployed independently multiple times, each time with a
different security policylink:#pgfId-1628040[111]. The container must
allow multiple-deployed enterprise beans to co-exist at runtime.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1628042]##[#50561028_82747]##Audit Trail

[#50561028_pgfId-1628044]##[#50561028_marker-1628043]##The EJB container
may provide a security audit trail mechanism. A security audit trail
mechanism typically logs all _java.security.Exceptions_ . It also logs
all denials of access to EJB servers, EJB containers, EJB business
interfaces, EJB component interfaces, EJB home interfaces, EJB
no-interface views, and EJB web service endpoints.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628046]##This section defines the security-related
responsibilities of the System Administrator. Note that some
responsibilities may be carried out by the Deployer instead, or may
require cooperation of the Deployer and the System Administrator.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1628047]##Security Domain Administration

[#50561028_pgfId-1628049]##The System Administrator is responsible for
the administration of principals. [#50561028_marker-1628048]##Security
domain administration is beyond the scope of the EJB specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1628050]##Typically, the System Administrator is

[#50561028_pgfId-1567040]##This chapter defines the EJB
container-managed Timer Service. The EJB Timer Service is a
container-provided service that allows the Bean Provider to register
enterprise beans for timer callbacks to occur according to a

time, or at specified intervals.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1555601]##Overview

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1555602]##Enterprise applications that model
workflow-type business processes are dependent on notifications that
certain temporal events have occurred in order to manage the semantic
state transitions that are intrinsic to the business processes that they
model.

[#50561028_pgfId-1555603]##The EJB Timer Service is a container-managed
service that allows callbacks to be scheduled for time-based events. The
container provides a reliable and transactional notification service for
timed events. Timer notifications may be scheduled to occur according to

[#50561028_pgfId-1558099]##The Timer Service is implemented by the EJB
container. An enterprise bean accesses this service by means of
dependency injection, through the _EJBContext_ interface, or through
lookup in the JNDI namespace.

[#50561028_pgfId-1555604]##The EJB Timer Service is a coarse-grained
timer notification service that is designed for use in the modeling of
application-level processes. It is not intended for the modeling of
real-time events.

[#50561028_pgfId-1555605]##While timer durations are expressed in
millisecond units, this is because the millisecond is the unit of time
granularity used by the APIs of the Java SE platform. It is expected

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1701405]##The EJB Timer Service is a container-provided
service that allows enterprise beans to be registered for timer callback
methods to occur according to a calendar-based schedule, at a specified
time, after a specified elapsed time, or after specified intervals. The
Timer Service provides methods for the programmatic creation and
cancellation of timers, as well as for locating the timers that are
associated with a bean or with all beans in an EJB module. Timers can
also be created automatically by the container at deployment time based
on metadata in the bean class or in the deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1663712]##A timer is created to schedule timed
callbacks. The bean class of an enterprise bean that uses the Timer
Service can provide one or more timeout callback methods. A bean can
have one or more callback methods corresponding to automatically-created
timers as well as a callback method corresponding to one or more
programmatically-created timers.

[#50561028_pgfId-1677980]##For programmatically created timers, the
timeout callback method must either be a single method that is annotated
with the _Timeout_ annotation or the bean must implement the
_javax.ejb.TimedObject_ interface. The _javax.ejb.TimedObject_ interface
has a single method, the timer callback method _ejbTimeout_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1663713]##For automatically created timers, the
Schedule annotation denotes its the timeout method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1677985]##Timers can be created for stateless session
beans, singleton session beans, message-driven
beanslink:#pgfId-1663788[112]. Timers cannot be created for stateful
session beanslink:#pgfId-1663716[113].

[#50561028_pgfId-1692102]##The timeout callback method invocation for a
timer that is created for a stateless session bean or a message-driven
bean may be called on any bean instance in the pooled state.

[#50561028_pgfId-1692236]##The timeout callback method for a
programmatically created persistent timer will be invoked on the JVM on
which the timer was created or on another JVM instance across which the
container is distributed. The timeout callback method for a
programmatically created non-persistent timer will be invoked on the JVM
on which the timer was created. The timeout callback method for a
programmatically created timer is invoked on a single JVM instance
regardless of the number of JVMs across which the container is
distributed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1701887]##For each automatically-created persistent
timer, the container creates a single persistent timer, regardless of
the number of JVMs across which the container is distributed. For
automatically-created non-persistent timers, the container creates a new
non-persistent timer during application initialization for each JVM
across which the container is distributed.

[#50561028_pgfId-1701888]##In the event of a container crash or
container shutdown, the timeout callback method for a persistent timer
that has not been cancelled will be invoked on a new JVM when the
container is restarted or on another JVM instance across which the
container is distributed. This rule applies to both programmatically or
automatically created persistent timers.

[#50561028_pgfId-1692062]##When the time specified at timer creation
elapses, the container invokes the associated timeout callback method of
the bean. A timer may be cancelled before its expiration. If a timer is
cancelled, its associated timeout callback method is not
calledlink:#pgfId-1692065[114]. A timer is cancelled by calling its
_cancel_ method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1688598]##Invocations of the timeout callback methods
and the methods of the Timer Service to programmatically create timers
and to cancel timers are typically made within a transaction.

[#50561028_pgfId-1558116]##The Timer Service is intended for the
modelling of long-lived business processes. Timers survive container
crashes, server shutdown, and the activation/passivation and load/store
cycles of the enterprise beans that are registered with them. These
persistent guarantees can optionally be disabled on a per-timer basis.

[#50561028_pgfId-1687919]##The Timer Service allows a timer callback
schedule to be expressed using a calendar-based syntax that is modeled
after the UNIX cron facility. Calendar-based expressions can be used
both for programmatic timer creation and for automatic timer creation,
and can be specified by means of annotations or the deployment
descriptor. Each of these approaches for expressing the calendar-based
schedule shares common syntax and defaults.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643863]##Each attribute supports values expressed in
one of the following forms:

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1643864]##Single Value

[#50561028_pgfId-1678032]##Use of a single value constrains the
attribute to only one of its possible values.

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1643867]##Wild Card

[#50561028_pgfId-1643868]##The wild card " _*_ " represents all possible
values for a given attribute.

[#50561028_pgfId-1643869]## _Examples:_

[#50561028_pgfId-1678618]## _second = "*"_

[#50561028_pgfId-1650064]## _dayOfWeek = "*"_

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1649260]##List

[#50561028_pgfId-1649261]##A list constrains the attribute to two or
more allowable values or ranges, with a comma used as a separator
character and a dash used to indicate an inclusive range. Each item in
the list must be an individual attribute value or a range. List items
cannot themselves be lists, wild-cards, or increments. Duplicate values
are allowed, but are ignored.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649262]## _Examples:_

[#50561028_pgfId-1678671]## _second = "10,20,30"_

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1643873]##Range

[#50561028_pgfId-1652940]##A range constrains the attribute to an
inclusive range of values, with a dash separating both ends of the
range. Each side of the range must be an individual attribute value.
Members of a range cannot themselves be lists, wild-cards, ranges, or
increments. In range "x-y", if _x_ is larger than _y_ , the range is
equivalent to "x-max, min-y", where max is the largest value of the
corresponding attribute and min is the smallest. The range "x-x", where
both range values are the same, is equivalent to the single value x. The
dayOfWeek range "0-7" is equivalent to " _*_ ".

======= [#50561028_pgfId-1644182]##Increments

[#50561028_pgfId-1652933]##The forward slash constrains an attribute
based on a starting point and an interval, and is used to specify every
N \{ seconds | minutes | hours } within the \{ minute | hour | day }
respectively. For an expression x/y, the attribute is constrained to
every yth value within the set of allowable values beginning at time x.
The x value is inclusive. The wildcard character ( _*_ ) can be used in
the x position, and is equivalent to 0. Increments are only supported
within the second, minute, and hour attributes. For the second and
minute attributes, x and y must each be in the range [0,59]. For the
hour attribute, _x_ and y must each be in the range [0,23].

creation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1644206]##For calendar-based timers, the schedule is
expressed by a ScheduleExpression helper object passed as a parameter to
a createCalendarTimer method. The ScheduleExpression object represents a
calendar based timer expression conforming to the requirements in

implement the _javax.ejb.TimedObject_ interface. The _TimedObject_

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1644109]##[#50561028_50942]##Timeout Callback Method Requirements

[#50561028_pgfId-1555647]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1636947]##A timeout callback method must have one of
the two signatures below, where <METHOD> designates the method
namelink:#pgfId-1598154[119].

[#50561028_pgfId-1644568]##A timeout callback method can have public,
private, protected, or package level access. A timeout callback method
must not be declared as _final_ or _static_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1644561]##Timeout callback methods must not throw
application exceptions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1596607]##When a timer expires (i.e., after one of its
scheduled times arrives or after the absolute time specified has
passed), the container calls the associated timeout method of the bean
that was registered for the timer. The timeout method contains the
business logic that the Bean Provider supplies to handle the timeout
event. The container calls the timeout method with the timer that has
expired. The Bean Provider can use the _getInfo_ method to retrieve the
information that was supplied when the timer was created. This
information may be useful in enabling the timed object to recognize the
significance of the timer expiration.

[#50561028_pgfId-1596546]##The container interleaves calls to a timeout
callback method with the calls to the business methods and the life
cycle callback methods of the bean. The time at which a timeout callback
method is called may therefore not correspond exactly to the time
specified at timer creation. If multiple timers have been created for a
bean and will expire at approximately the same times, the Bean Provider
must be prepared to handle timeout callbacks that are out of sequence.
The Bean Provider must be prepared to handle extraneous calls to a
_timeout_ _callback_ method in the event that a timer expiration is
outstanding when a call to the cancellation method has been made.

[#50561028_pgfId-1555651]##In general, _a_ timeout callback method can
perform the same operations as business methods from the component
interface or message listener methods. See Tables
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_35524[See Operations Allowed in the Methods of a
Stateless Session Bean], link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42676[See Operations
Allowed in the Methods of a Message-Driven Bean],
link:../Optional/Chapters.htm#31076[], and
link:../Optional/Chapters.htm#22110[] for the specification of the
operations that may be performed by a timeout callback method.

[#50561028_pgfId-1555652]##Since a timeout callback method is an
internal method of the bean class, it has no client security context.
When _getCallerPrincipal_ is called from within a timeout callback
method, it returns the container’s representation of the unauthenticated
identity.

[#50561028_pgfId-1555653]##If the timed object needs to make use of the
identity of the timer to recognize the significance of the timer
expiration, it may use the _equals_ method to compare it with any other
timer references it might have outstanding.

[#50561028_pgfId-1705550]##If the timer is a single-action timer, the
container removes the timer after the timeout callback method has been
successfully invoked (e.g., when the transaction that has been started
for the invocation of the timeout callback method commits). If any
method is invoked on the timer after the termination of the timeout
callback method, a _NoSuchObjectLocalException_ must be thrown.

[#50561028_pgfId-1653096]##If the timer is a calendar-based timer, the
container removes the timer after the timeout callback method has been
successfully invoked (e.g., when the transaction that has been started
for the invocation of the timeout callback method commits) and there are
no future timeouts corresponding to the timer’s schedule expression. If
any method is invoked on the timer after it has been removed, the
_NoSuchObjectLocalException_ must be thrown. If the bean invokes the
getNextTimeout or getTimeRemaining method on the timer associated with a
timeout callback while within the timeout callback, and there are no
future timeouts for this calendar-based timer, the
NoMoreTimeoutsException must be thrown.

method after the timed duration or the absolute time specification in
the timer creation method has passed. The container must also call a
timeout callback method if a time matching the timer’s schedule
expression has been reached. The Timer Service must begin to count down
the timer duration upon timer creation. The container must call a

[#50561028_pgfId-1385799]##The [#50561028_marker-1503471]##deployment
descriptor is part of the contract between the ejb-jar and/or _.war_
file producer and consumer. This contract covers both the passing of
enterprise beans from the Bean Provider to the Application Assembler,
and from the Application Assembler to the Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385800]##An [#50561028_marker-1503472]##ejb-jar file
or _.war_ file produced by the Bean Provider contains one or more
enterprise beans and typically does not contain application assembly
instructions. An ejb-jar file or . _war_ file produced by an Application
Assembler contains one or more enterprise beans, plus application
assembly information describing how the enterprise beans are combined
into a single application deployment unit.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385801]##The Java EE specification defines how
enterprise beans and other application components contained in multiple
such files can be assembled into an application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385803]##[#50561028_marker-1385802]##The role of the
deployment descriptor is to capture declarative information that is not
included directly in the enterprise beans’ code and that is intended for
the consumer of the ejb-jar file or _.war_ file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385805]##[#50561028_marker-1385804]##There are two
basic kinds of information in the deployment descriptor:

[#50561028_pgfId-1385806]##Enterprise beans’ _structural information_ .
Structural information describes the structure of an enterprise bean and
declares an enterprise bean’s external dependencies. Structural
information may be provided using metadata annotations in the beans’
code or in the deployment descriptor. The structural information cannot,
in general, be changed because doing so could break the enterprise
bean’s function.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385807]##Application _assembly information_ .
Application assembly information describes how the enterprise beans in
the ejb-jar file or _.war_ file are composed into a larger application
deployment unit. Providing assembly information—whether in metadata
annotations or in the deployment descriptor—is optional for the ejb-jar
file or _.war_ file producer. Assembly level information can be changed
without breaking the enterprise bean’s function, although doing so may
alter the behavior of an assembled application.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1385809]##[#50561028_87744]##Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1385810]##The Bean Provider is responsible for
providing in the deployment descriptor the following structural
information for each enterprise bean if this information has not be
provided in metadata annotations or is to be defaulted.

[#50561028_pgfId-1701674]##[#50561028_marker-1701672]##The Bean Provider
uses the enterprise-beans element to list the enterprise beans in the
ejb-jar file or _.war_ file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1701675]##NOTE: The following annotations are
component-defining annotations and cannot be overridden by the
deployment descriptor:

[#50561028_pgfId-1701576]## _Stateless_

[#50561028_pgfId-1701584]## _Stateful_

[#50561028_pgfId-1701589]##Singleton

[#50561028_pgfId-1701594]## _MessageDriven_

[#50561028_pgfId-1701575]##[#50561028_marker-1385813]##The Bean Provider
must provide the following information for each enterprise bean:

[#50561028_pgfId-1385816]##Enterprise bean’s name. A logical name is
assigned to each enterprise bean in the ejb-jar file or _.war_ file. The
Bean Provider can specify the enterprise bean’s name in the ejb-name
element. If the enterprise bean’s name is not explicitly specified in
metadata annotations or in the deployment descriptor, it defaults to the
unqualified name of the bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1701610]##Enterprise bean’s class. If the bean class
has not been annotated with a component-defining annotation,
[#50561028_marker-1701611]##the Bean Provider must use the _ejb-class_
element of the _session_ or _message-driven_ deployment descriptor
element to specify the fully-qualified name of the Java class that
implements the enterprise bean’s business methods. The Bean Provider
specifies the enterprise bean’s class name in the ejb-class element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1611348]##Enterprise bean’s local business interface.
If the bean class has a local business interface and neither implements
the business interface nor specifies it as a local business interface
using metadata annotations on the bean class, the Bean Provider must
specify the fully-qualified name of the enterprise bean’s local business
interface in the _business-local_ element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1611363]##Enterprise bean’s remote business interface.
If the bean class has a remote business interface and neither implements
nor specifies it as a remote business interface using metadata
annotations on the bean class, the Bean Provider must specify the
fully-qualified name of the enterprise bean’s remote business interface
in the _business-remote_ element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385820]##Enterprise bean’s remote home interface. If
the bean class has a remote home interface, and the remote home
interface has not been specified using metadata annotations, the Bean
Provider must specify the fully-qualified name of the enterprise bean’s
remote home interface in the home element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385822]##Enterprise bean’s remote component interface.
If the bean class has a remote component interface, and the remote home
interface has not been specified using metadata annotations, the Bean
Provider must specify the fully-qualified name of the enterprise bean’s
remote component interface in the remote element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1468894]##Enterprise bean’s local home interface. If
the bean class has a local home interface, and the local home interface
has not been specified using metadata annotations, the Bean Provider
must specify the fully-qualified name of the enterprise bean’s local
home interface in the _local-home_ element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1468896]##Enterprise bean’s local component interface.
If the bean class has a local component interface, and the local home
interface has not been specified using metadata annotations, the Bean
Provider must specify the fully-qualified name of the enterprise bean’s
local component interface in the local element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664505]##Enterprise bean’s no-interface view. If the
bean class exposes a no-interface view and the bean exposes at least one
other client view (local, remote, 2.x local home, 2.x remote home, web
service), or if the bean class does not have an empty implements clause
and does not specify no-interface view using metadata annotations on the
bean class, or if the _metadata-complete_ attribute has been set to
_true_ , the Bean Provider must specify the local-bean element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1551974]## _Enterprise bean’s web service endpoint
interface._ If the bean class has a web service endpoint interface, and
the interface has not been specified using metadata annotations on the
bean class, the Bean Provider must specify the fully-qualified name of
the enterprise bean’s web service endpoint interface in the
_service-endpoint_ element. This element may only be used for stateless
session beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385824]##Enterprise bean’s type.
[#50561028_marker-1385823]##The enterprise bean types are: session, and
message-driven. The Bean Provider must use the appropriate session, or
_message-driven_ element to declare the enterprise bean’s structural
information if a component-defining annotation has not been used for
this purpose. If the bean’s type has been specified by means of a
component-defining annotation, its type cannot be overridden by means of
the deployment descriptor. The bean’s type (and its session type), if
specified, must be the same as that specified in annotations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385825]## _Re-entrancy indication_
[#50561028_marker-1503473]##. Session beans and message-driven beans are
never re-entrant.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385827]##Session bean’s state management type.
[#50561028_marker-1385826]##If the enterprise bean is a session bean and
the bean class has not been annotated with the _Stateful_ , _Stateless_
_, or_ _Singleton_ _annotation,_ the Bean Provider must use the
session-type element to declare whether the session bean is a stateful,
stateless, or singleton session bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385829]##Session or message-driven bean’s transaction
demarcation type. [#50561028_marker-1385828]##If the enterprise bean is
a session bean or message-driven bean, the Bean Provider may use the
transaction-type element to declare whether transaction demarcation is
performed by the enterprise bean or by the container. If the neither the
_TransactionType_ annotation is used nor the _transaction-type_
deployment descriptor element, the bean will have container managed
transaction demarcation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664529]##Session bean’s concurrency management type.
If the enterprise bean is a singleton session bean, the Bean Provider
may use the concurrency-management-type element to declare whether
concurrency management is handled by the container or is performed by
the Bean Providerlink:#pgfId-1709203[121]. If neither the
ConcurrencyManagement annotation is used nor the
concurrency-management-type deployment descriptor element, the singleton
session bean will have container-managed concurrency.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385842]##Environment entries. The Bean Provider must
declare any enterprise bean’s [#50561028_marker-1503479]##environment
entries that have not been defined by means of metadata annotations, as
specified in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_15410[See Bean Provider’s
Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1385846]##Resource manager connection factory
references. The Bean Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s
[#50561028_marker-1503480]##resource manager connection factory
references that have not been defined by means of metadata annotations,
as specified in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_17903[See Bean
Provider’s Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1385850]## _Resource environment references_
[#50561028_marker-1503481]##. The Bean Provider must declare any
enterprise bean’s references to administered objects that are associated
with resources and that have not been defined by means of metadata
annotations, as specified in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_11178[See
Bean Provider’s Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1385851]##[#50561028_marker-1503482]##EJB references.
The Bean Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s references to the
remote home or remote business view of other enterprise beans that have
not been defined by means of metadata annotations, as specified in
Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_38411[See Bean Provider’s
Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1468938]##[#50561028_marker-1503483]##EJB local
references. The Bean Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s
references to the local home or local business or no-interface view of
other enterprise beans that have not been defined by means of metadata
annotations, as specified in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_38411[See
Bean Provider’s Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1551975]## _Web service references_ . The Bean Provider
must declare any enterprise bean’s references to web service interfaces
that have not been defined by means of metadata annotations, as
specified in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_92545[See Web Service
References].

[#50561028_pgfId-1630875]## _Persistence unit references_ . The Bean
Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s references to an entity
manager factory for a persistence unit that have not been defined by
means of metadata annotations, as specified in Subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_27067[See Persistence Unit References].

[#50561028_pgfId-1630896]## _Persistence context references_ . The Bean
Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s references to an entity
manager for a persistence context that have not been defined by means of
metadata annotations, as specified in Subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_48657[See Persistence Context References].

[#50561028_pgfId-1561163]## _Message destination references_ . The Bean
Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s references to message
destinations that have not been defined by means of metadata
annotations, as specified in Subsection link:Ejb.htm#50561028_72486[See
Bean Provider’s Responsibilities].

[#50561028_pgfId-1385855]##[#50561028_marker-1503484]##Security role
references. The Bean Provider must declare any enterprise bean’s
references to security roles that have not been defined by means of
metadata annotations, as specified in Subsection
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_95803[See Declaration of Security Roles Referenced
from the Bean’s Code].

[#50561028_pgfId-1385859]## _Message-driven bean’s configuration
properties. The Bean Provider may provide input to the Deployer as to
how a message-driven bean should be configured upon activation in its
operational environment. Activation configuration properties for a JMS
message-driven bean include information about a bean’s intended
destination type, its message selector, and its acknowledgement mode.
Other bean types may make use of different properties. See
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_30765[See Java EE™ Connector Architecture, version
1.7 (Connector). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322.]._

[#50561028_pgfId-1611438]## _Message-driven bean’s destination._ The
Bean Provider may provide advice to the Application Assembler as to the
destination type to which a [#50561028_marker-1503485]##message-driven
bean should be assigned when linking message destinations

[#50561028_pgfId-1611441]## _Interceptors._ The Bean Provider must
declare any interceptor classes and methods that have not been declared
by means of metadata annotations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664542]##Schedule-based timers. The Bean Provider must
declare any automatic schedule-based timers that have not been declared
by means of metadata annotations.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664548]##Asynchronous methods. The Bean Provider must
declare any asynchronous business methods that have not been designated
as asynchronous by means of metadata annotions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664565]## _Singleton session bean initialization
ordering dependencies._ The Bean Provider may provide advice to the
Application Assembler as to the initialization ordering dependencies

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1561183]##[#50561028_60935]##Application Assembler’s Responsibility

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1689421]##The Application Assembler assembles
enterprise beans into deployment units. The Application Assembler’s
input is one or more enterprise beans, un-assembled or contained in one
or more ejb-jar and/or _.war_ files provided by one or more Bean
Providers. All of the input could be combined into a single output
ejb-jar file or _.war_ file, or could be be split into multiple output
ejb-jar and/or _.war_ files. Each output ejb-jar file or _.war_ file is
either a deployment unit intended for the Deployer or a partially
assembled application that is intended for another Application
Assembler.

[#50561028_pgfId-1689422]##The Bean Provider and Application Assembler
may be the same person or organization. In such a case, the person or
organization performs the responsibilities described both in this and
the previous sections.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385874]##The Application Assembler may modify the
following information that was specified by the Bean Provider:

[#50561028_pgfId-1385875]##Values of environment entries. The
Application Assembler may change existing values and/or define new
values of environment properties.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385876]##Description fields. The Application Assembler
may change existing or create new description elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1512300]## _Message-driven bean message selector_ . The
Application Assembler may further restrict, but not replace, the value
of the _messageSelector_ [#50561028_marker-1512301]##
_activation-config-property_ element of a JMS message-driven
bean—whether this was defined in metadata annotations or the deployment
descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664552]##Timer schedule attributes. The Application
Assembler may override timer attributes, except for the method to which
a timer’s timeouts have been assigned.

[#50561028_pgfId-1454623]##In general, the Application Assembler should
never modify any of the following.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385882]##Enterprise bean’s abstract schema name. The
Application Assembler should not change the enterprise bean’s name
defined in the abstract-schema-name element since EJB QL queries may
depend on the content of this element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1512290]##Relationship role source element. The
Application Assembler should not change the value of an ejb-name element
in the _relationship-role-source_ [#50561028_marker-1503490]## element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385886]##If any of these elements must be modified by
the Application Assembler in order to resolve name clashes during the
merging of ejb-jar and/or _.war_ files, the Application Assembler must
also modify all ejb-ql query strings that depend on the value of the
modified element(s).

[#50561028_pgfId-1460140]##The Application Assembler must not, in
general, modify any other information listed in Section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_87744[See Bean Provider’s Responsibilities] that
was provided in the input ejb-jar file or _.war_ file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385888]##[#50561028_marker-1460146]##The Application
Assembler may, but is not required to, specify any of the following
application assembly information:

[#50561028_pgfId-1385889]##Binding of enterprise bean references. The
Application Assembler may link an [#50561028_marker-1503491]##enterprise
bean reference to another enterprise bean in the ejb-jar file or _.war_
file or in an ejb-jar file in the same Java EE application unit. The
Application Assembler creates the link by adding the
[#50561028_marker-1503492]##ejb-link element to the referencing bean.
The Application Assembler uses the _ejb-name_ of the referenced bean for
the link. If there are multiple enterprise beans with the same
_ejb-name_ , the Application Assembler uses the path name specifying the
location of the ejb-jar file that contains the referenced component. The
path name is relative to the referencing ejb-jar file or . _war_ file.
The Application Assembler appends the _ejb-name_ of the referenced bean
to the path name separated by _#_ . This allows multiple beans with the
same name to be uniquely identified.

[#50561028_pgfId-1561186]##Linking of message destination references.
The Application Assembler may link message consumers and producers
through common message destinations specified in the ejb-jar file or
_.war_ file or in the same Java EE application unit. The Application
Assembler creates the link by adding the message-destination-link
element to the referencing bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385890]##Security roles. The Application Assembler may
define one or more [#50561028_marker-1503493]##security roles. The
security roles define the recommended security roles for the clients of
the enterprise beans. The Application Assembler defines the security
roles using the [#50561028_marker-1503494]##security-role elements.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385891]##Method permissions. The Application Assembler
may define [#50561028_marker-1503495]##method permissions. Method
permission is a binary relation between the security roles and the
methods of the business interfaces, home interfaces, component
interfaces, and/or web service endpoints of the enterprise beans. The
Application Assembler defines method permissions using the
[#50561028_marker-1503496]##method-permission elements. The Application
Assembler may augment or ovrride method permissions defined by the Bean
Provider—whether in metadata annotations or in the deployment
descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664586]##Singleton session bean initialization
ordering. The Application Assembler may define or override the
depends-on initialization ordering metadata for a singleton session
bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664594]##Stateful timeout. The Application Assembler
may define or override the stateful timeout.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664606]##Singleton session bean startup. The
Application Assembler may override the eager startup designation of a
singleton session bean.

[#50561028_pgfId-1664598]##Access timeouts. The Application Assembler
may override the access timeout values for methods governed by
container-managed concurrency semantics of stateful and singleton
session beans.

[#50561028_pgfId-1503546]##Linking of security role references. If the
Application Assembler defines security roles in the deployment
descriptor, the Application Assembler may link the
[#50561028_marker-1503547]##security role references declared by the
Bean Provider to the security roles. The Application Assembler defines
these links using the [#50561028_marker-1503548]##role-link element.

[#50561028_pgfId-1393410]## _Security identity_ . The Application
Assembler may specify whether the caller’s
[#50561028_marker-1503499]##security identity should be used for the
execution of the methods of an enterprise bean or whether a specific
run-as security identity should be used. The Application Assembler may
override a security identity defined by the Bean Provider—whether in
metadata annotations or in the deployment descriptor

[#50561028_pgfId-1385893]##Transaction attributes. The Application
Assembler may define the value of the
[#50561028_marker-1503500]##transaction attributes for the methods of
the business interface, home interface, component interface,
no-interface view, web service endpoint, and _TimedObject_ interface of
the enterprise beans that require
[#50561028_marker-1503501]##container-managed transaction demarcation.
All session and message-driven beans declared by the Bean Provider as
transaction-type Container require container-managed transaction
demarcation. The Application Assembler uses the
[#50561028_marker-1503502]##container-transaction elements to declare
the transaction attributes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1611387]## _Interceptors_ . The Application Assembler
may override, augment, and/or reorder the interceptor methods defined by
the Bean Provider—whether in metadata annotations or in the deployment
descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1385895]##If an input ejb-jar file or _.war_ file
contains application assembly information, the Application Assembler is
allowed to change the application assembly information supplied in the
input file. (This could happen when the input file was produced by
another Application Assembler.)

[#50561028_pgfId-1561208]##[#50561028_marker-1561207]##The deployment
descriptor produced by the Bean Provider and/or the Application
Assembler must conform to the XML Schema definition in Section

=== [#50561028_pgfId-1657102]##[#50561028_32342]##Packaging

[#50561028_pgfId-1511541]##The ejb-jar file is the standard format for
the packaging of enterprise beans. Enterprise beans can also be packaged
within a web application module (.war file). The ejb-jar file or .war
file format is used to package un-assembled enterprise beans (the Bean
Provider’s output), and to package assembled applications (the
Application Assembler’s output).

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1511542]##Overview

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1644644]##The ejb-jar file and .war file formats serve
as the contract between the Bean Provider and the Application Assembler,
and between the Application Assembler and the Deployer.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511545]##[#50561028_marker-1511544]##An ejb-jar file
produced by the Bean Provider contains one or more enterprise beans that
typically do not contain application assembly instructions. The ejb-jar
file produced by an Application Assembler (which can be the same person
or organization as the Bean Provider) contains one or more enterprise
beans, plus application assembly information describing how the
enterprise beans are combined into a single application deployment unit.

[#50561028_pgfId-1644649]##A .war file is not required to contain any
enterprise beans. A .war file produced by a Bean Provider contains one
or more enterprise beans that typically do not contain application
assembly instructions. A .war file produced by an Application Assembler
(which can be the same person or organization as the Bean Provider)
contains one or more enterprise beans, plus application assembly
information describing how the enterprise beans are combined into a
single application deployment unit.

[#50561028_pgfId-1680266]##An ejb-jar file is designed specifically for
the packaging of enterprise beans. An ejb-jar file that is packaged
stand-alone or within an _.ear_ file constitutes a Java EE module.

[#50561028_pgfId-1680286]##While the use of an ejb-jar file within a
_.war_ file is supported by this specification, an ejb-jar file within a
_.war_ file does not constitute a Java EE module. See section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_70682[See Enterprise Beans Packaged in a .war
file].

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1511546]##Deployment Descriptor

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1511548]##[#50561028_marker-1511547]##The EJB
deployment descriptor is optional in either packaging scenario. If a
deployment descriptor is provided it must conform to the format defined
in Chapter link:Ejb.htm#50561028_84706[See Deployment Descriptor].

[#50561028_pgfId-1644669]##In a .war file, the deployment descriptor is
stored with the name WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml.

[#50561028_pgfId-1679969]##In an ejb-jar file that is packaged
stand-alone or within an _.ear_ file, the deployment descriptor is
stored with the name META-INF/ejb-jar.xml. If the enterprise beans are
contained in an ejb-jar file packaged within a _.war_ file, the
deployment descriptor is stored with the name WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml. When
enterprise beans are packaged within a _.war_ , the ejb-jar file does
_not_ constitute a separate module, and there can portably be only one
_ejb-jar.xml_ file. See section link:Ejb.htm#50561028_70682[See
Enterprise Beans Packaged in a .war file].

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1511553]##[#50561028_94776]##Packaging Requirements

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1511555]##[#50561028_marker-1511554]##The ejb-jar file
or .war file must contain, either by inclusion or by reference, the
class files of each enterprise bean as follows:

[#50561028_pgfId-1511556]##The enterprise bean class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511557]##The enterprise bean business interfaces, web
service endpoint interfaces, and home and component interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1630841]##Interceptor classes.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511559]##We say that a jar file contains a second file
“by reference” if the second file is named in the Class-Path attribute
in the Manifest file of the referencing jar file or is contained (either
by inclusion or by reference) in another jar file that is named in the
Class-Path attribute in the Manifest file of the referencing jar file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511560]##The ejb-jar file or .war file must also
contain, either by inclusion or by reference, the class files for all
the classes and interfaces that each enterprise bean class and the
business interfaces, home interfaces, component interfaces, and/or web
service endpoints depend on, except Java EE and Java SE classes. This
includes their superclasses and superinterfaces, dependent classes, and
the classes and interfaces used as method parameters, results, and
exceptions.

[#50561028_pgfId-1680021]##The Application Assembler must not package
the stubs of the EJBHome and EJBObject interfaces in the ejb-jar file or
.war file. This includes the stubs for the enterprise beans whose
implementations are provided in the ejb-jar file or .war file as well as
the referenced enterprise beans. Generating the stubs is the
responsibility of the container. The stubs are typically generated by
the Container Provider’s deployment tools for each class that extends
the EJBHome or EJBObject interfaces, or they may be generated by the
container at runtime.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1680023]##[#50561028_70682]##Enterprise Beans Packaged in a .war file

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1686996]##An enterprise bean class with a
component-defining annotation defines an enterprise bean component when
packaged within the WEB-INF/classes directory or within a jar file
within the WEB-INF/lib directory. An enterprise bean can also be defined
via the WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1686997]##A _.war_ file may contain enterprise bean
classes in a combination of classes within the WEB-INF/classes directory
and one or more jar files within the WEB-INF/lib directory.

[#50561028_pgfId-1686981]## _A “ejb-jar” file in the WEB-INF/lib
directory that contains enterprise beans is not considered an
independent Java EE “module” in the way that a .war file, stand-alone
ejb-jar file, or an .ear-level ejb-jar file is considered a module. Such
an “ejb-jar file” does not define its own module name or its own
namespace for ejb-names, environment dependencies, persistence units,
etc. All such namespaces are scoped to the enclosing .war file. In that
sense, the packaging of enterprise bean classes in an “ejb-jar” file in
the WEB-INF/lib directory is merely a convenience. It is semantically
equivalent to packaging the classes within WEB-INF/classes_ directory
_._

[#50561028_pgfId-1686982]##A _.war_ file may contain an ejb-jar.xml
file. If present, the ejb-jar.xml is packaged as WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml. If
an ejb-jar.xml is present, it applies to all enterprise beans defined by
the .war file, independently of whether they are packaged with the
WEB-INF/classes directory or in a jar file within WEB-INF/lib directory.
The packaging of an _ejb-jar.xml_ file anywhere else within the _.war_
file is not portable and may result in a deployment error.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1648349]##Class Loading

[#50561028_pgfId-1645044]##Enterprise beans (and any related classes)
packaged in a .war file have the same class loading requirements as
other non-enterprise bean classes packaged in a .war file. This means,
for example, that a servlet packaged within a .war file is guaranteed to
have visibility to an enterprise bean component packaged within the same
.war file, and vice versa. Detailed class loading requirements for web
modules are covered in the Java EE Platform specification
[link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50453[See Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition
Specification Version 7 (Java EE).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342.]].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1645055]##Component Environment

[#50561028_pgfId-1645062]##In a .war file, there is a single component
naming environment shared between all the components (web, enterprise
bean, etc.) defined by the module. Each enterprise bean defined in the
.war file shares this single component environment namespace with all
other enterprise beans defined by the .war file and with all other web
components defined by the .war file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1645105]##The Bean Provider should be aware of this
name scoping behavior when selecting names of environment dependencies
for enterprise beans packaged within a .war file. Unlike enterprise
beans packaged in an ejb-jar file outside a .war file, the names of
environment entries defined by an enterprise bean inside a . _war_ file
can clash with names defined by other components. Likewise, enterprise
beans packaged in a .war file have visiblity to all environment entries
defined by any other components in the .war file, including any entries
defined within the _web.xml_ file. This is also true of the advanced
case in which the ejb-jar.xml file is used to define multiple bean
components based on the same bean class. Extra caution should be used
when configuring environment dependencies for such bean components.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1646477]##[#50561028_38717]##Visibility of the Local Client View

[#50561028_pgfId-1646481]##The local client view (including the
no-interface view) of an enterprise bean component defined within a .war
file is only required to be accessible to components within the same
.war file. Applications needing access to the local client view of an
enterprise bean from a different module in the same application should
use an ejb-jar file outside the _.war_ file to define the enterprise
bean that exposes the local client view.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1645075]##Ejb-names

[#50561028_pgfId-1664939]##A .war file has a single namespace for the
ejb-names of any enterprise beans it defines. This single ejb-name
namespace applies to all enterprise beans defined in the _.war_ file,
regardless of where in the .war file the enterprise beans are defined
and regardless of whether they are defined by means of the ejb-jar.xml
deployment descriptor or by annotations.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1645109]##Example

[#50561028_pgfId-1645133]##package com.acme;

component-defining annotation and a no-interface view. It is packaged in
a .war file under a WEB-INF/classes subdirectory corresponding to its
package name. The .war file also contains a Servlet.

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1511567]##The client view of an enterprise bean is
comprised of the business interfaces, no-interface view, or home and
component interfaces of the referenced enterprise bean, and other
classes that these interfaces depend on, such as their superclasses and
superinterfaces, the classes and interfaces used as method parameters,
results, and exceptions. The serializable application value classes,
including the classes which may be used as members of a collection in a
remote method call to an enterprise bean, are part of the client view.
An example of an application value class might be an _Address_ class
used as a parameter in a method call.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511569]##[#50561028_marker-1511568]##The ejb-jar file
or .war file producer can create an ejb-client JAR file for the ejb-jar
file or _.war_ file. The ejb-client JAR file contains all the class
files that a client program needs to use the client view of the
enterprise beans that are contained in the ejb-jar file or _.war_ file.
If this option is used, it is the responsibility of the Application
Assembler to include all the classes necessary to comprise the client
view of an enterprise bean in the ejb-client JAR file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511570]##The ejb-client JAR file is specified in the
_ejb-jar.xml_ deployment descriptor of the ejb-jar file or .war file
using the [#50561028_marker-1511571]##ejb-client-jar element. The value
of the ejb-client-jar element is the path name specifying the location
of the ejb-client JAR file in the containing
[#50561028_marker-1511572]##Java EE Enterprise Application Archive (
_.ear_ ) file. The path name is relative to the location of the
referencing ejb-jar file or . _war_ file.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511573]##The EJB specification does not specify
whether an ejb-jar file or .war file should include by copy or by
reference the classes that are in an ejb-client JAR file, but they must
be included either one way or the other. If the by-copy approach is
used, the producer simply includes all the class files in the ejb-client
JAR file also in the ejb-jar file or .war file. If the by-reference
approach is used, the ejb-jar file or .war file producer does not
duplicate the content of the ejb-client JAR file in the ejb-jar file or
.war file, but instead uses a Manifest Class-Path entry in the ejb-jar
file or .war file to specify that the ejb-jar file or .war file depends
on the ejb-client JAR at runtime. The use of the Class-Path entries in
JAR files and .war files is explained in the Java EE Platform
specification [link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50453[See Java™ Platform,
Enterprise Edition Specification Version 7 (Java EE).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342.]].

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1511577]##[#50561028_74226]##Requirements for Clients

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1511578]##The Application Assembler must construct the
application to insure that the client view classes are available to the
client at runtime. The client of an enterprise bean may be another
enterprise bean packaged in the same ejb-jar or different ejb-jar file,
another enterprise bean packaged in the same .war file or different .war
file, or the client may be another Java EE component, such as a web
component.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511579]##When clients packaged in jar files refer to
enterprise beans, the jar file that contains the client, e.g. an ejb-jar
file, should contain, either by inclusion or by reference, all the
client view classes of the referenced beans. The client view classes may
have been packaged in an ejb-client JAR file. In other words, the jar
file that contains the client should contain one of the following:

[#50561028_pgfId-1511580]##a reference to the ejb-client JAR file

[#50561028_pgfId-1511581]##a reference to the ejb-jar file that contains
the client view classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1511582]##a copy of the client view classes

[#50561028_pgfId-1511583]##The client may also require the use of system
value classes (e.g., the serializable value classes implementing the
javax.ejb.Handle, javax.ejb.HomeHandle, javax.ejb.EJBMetaData,
java.util.Enumeration, java.util.Collection, and java.util.Iterator
interfaces), although these are not packaged with the application. It is
the responsibility of the provider of the container hosting the
referenced beans to provide the system value classes and make them
available for use when the client is deployed. See Section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_96236[See System Value Classes].

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1511587]##Example

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1511588]##In this example, the Bean Provider has chosen
to package the enterprise bean client view classes in a separate _.jar_
file and to reference that _.jar_ file from the other _.jar_ files that
need those classes. Those classes are needed both by _ejb2.jar_ ,
packaged in the same application as _ejb1.jar_ , and by _ejb3.jar_ ,
packaged in a different application. Those classes are also needed by
_ejb1.jar_ itself because they define the remote interface of the
enterprise beans in _ejb1.jar_ , and the Bean Provider has chosen the
_by reference_ approach to making these classes available.

[#50561028_pgfId-1511589]##The deployment descriptor for _ejb1.jar_
names the client view jar file in the _ejb-client-jar_ element. Because
_ejb2.jar_ requires these client view classes, it includes a Class-Path
reference to _ejb1_client.jar_ .

[#50561028_pgfId-1511590]##The Class-Path mechanism must be used by
components in _app2.ear_ to reference the client view jar file that

=== [#50561028_pgfId-1392743]##[#50561028_61764]##Runtime Environment

[#50561028_pgfId-1649008]##This chapter defines the application
programming interfaces (APIs) that a compliant EJB container must make
available to the enterprise bean instances at runtime. These APIs can be
used by portable enterprise beans because the APIs are guaranteed to be
available in all EJB containers.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649009]##The set of required APIs is divided into two
categories: a complete set and a minimum set. The minimum set is also
referred to as “EJB Lite.” This reflects the ability of a Server
Provider to provide an EJB container within a product that implements
the Full Java EE Platform or within a subset profile such as the Java EE
Web Profile. The _complete_ set is required within an implementation of
the Full Java EE Platform. The minimum set must be supported within an
implementation of the Java EE Web Profile. Profile requirements are
described within the Java EE Platform specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50453[See Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition
Specification Version 7 (Java EE).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1645623]##The chapter also defines the restrictions
that the EJB Container Provider can impose on the functionality that it
provides to the enterprise beans. These restrictions are necessary to
enforce security and to allow the container to properly manage the
runtime environment.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1392746]##[#50561028_73802]##EJB Lite and Other EJB API Groups

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1728497]##The EJB API is comprised of a large feature
set with support for implementing business logic in a wide variety of
enterprise applications. However, the full range of API contracts is not
always crucial for all runtime environments. In addition, the breadth of
the full API can present challenges for developers just getting started
with the Enterprise JavaBeans technology.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649038]##For these reasons this specification defines
a minimal subset of the EJB API known as EJB Lite. EJB Lite is not a
product. Rather, it is a proper subset of the full EJB API that includes
a small, powerful selection of EJB features suitable for writing
portable transactional business logic. The definition of EJB Lite gives
vendors an option to implement only a portable subset of the EJB API
within their product. The vastly reduced size of the feature set makes
it suitable for inclusion in a wider range of Java products, many of
which have much smaller installation and runtime footprints than a
typical full Java EE implementation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649051]##An EJB Lite application is merely an EJB
application whose EJB API usage falls within the EJB Lite subset. There
are no special APIs defined only for EJB Lite. Therefore, any EJB Lite
application can be deployed on any Java EE product that implements
Enterprise JavaBeans technology, whether that product supports EJB Lite
or the full EJB API.

[#50561028_pgfId-1649062]##As detailed in
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_25987[See EJB API Groups], the EJB Lite API is
composed of the following subset of the EJB API:

[#50561028_pgfId-1649065]##Stateless, stateful, and singleton session
bean components only

[#50561028_pgfId-1649070]##Local business interface and no-interface

[#50561028_pgfId-1728686]##An EJB Lite container provider may support

link:Ejb.htm#50561028_25987[See EJB API Groups]. If it does, the
following rules apply:

[#50561028_pgfId-1722665]##If any feature in a group is supported, the
whole group must be supported.

[#50561028_pgfId-1722666]##Support for these features must adhere to the
requirements of this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1722749]##Except for the programmatic timers in the
Persistent EJB Timer Service group, the EJB Container must detect that
an application depends on a feature that is not supported and fail
deployment of the application. A product may offer a deployment option
to force deployment of applications that use EJB features not supported
by the product. Use of these features must fail at runtime.

[#50561028_pgfId-1722750]##If the Persistent EJB Timer Service group is
not supported, and an application attempts to create a programmatic
persistent timer, the EJB container must throw the EJBException when the
API is invoked.

[#50561028_pgfId-1680449]##[#50561028_marker-1680448]##The requirements
on APIs provided by the Container are determined by the associated
profile specification, e.g. the Java EE specification

Specification Version 7 (Java EE). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342.]
or the Web Profile Specification.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1392760]##[#50561028_32418]##Programming Restrictions

[#50561028_pgfId-1392762]##[#50561028_marker-1392761]##This section
describes the programming restrictions that a Bean Provider must follow
to ensure that the enterprise bean is _portable_ and can be deployed in
any compliant EJB container. The restrictions apply to the
implementation of the business methods. Section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_50409[See Container Provider’s Responsibility],
which describes the container’s view of these restrictions, defines the
programming environment that all EJB containers must provide.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392766]##An enterprise bean must not use read/write
[#50561028_marker-1503514]##static fields. Using read-only static fields
is allowed. Therefore, it is recommended that all static fields in the
enterprise bean class be declared as final.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392767]##This rule is required to ensure consistent
runtime semantics because while some EJB containers may use a single JVM
to execute all enterprise bean’s instances, others may distribute the
instances across multiple JVMs.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392768]##An enterprise bean must not use
[#50561028_marker-1503515]##thread synchronization primitives to
synchronize execution of multiple instances, unless it is a singleton
session bean with bean-managed concurrency.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392769]##This is for the same reason as above.
Synchronization would not work if the EJB container distributed
enterprise bean’s instances across multiple JVMs.

[#50561028_pgfId-1691184]##An enterprise bean must not use the
[#50561028_marker-1691183]##AWT functionality to attempt to output
information to a display, or to input information from a keyboard.

[#50561028_pgfId-1691185]##Servers do not allow direct interaction
between an application program and a keyboard/display attached to the
server system.

[#50561028_pgfId-1691264]##An enterprise bean should exercise caution
when using the [#50561028_marker-1691263]##Java I/O package to attempt
to access files and directories in the file system.

[#50561028_pgfId-1692200]##The file system APIs are not well-suited for
business components to access data. Files might not be accessible from
all instances, or their content might be different on different
instances, and coordinating updates to the file can be difficult.
Business components should use a resource manager API, such as JDBC, to
store data.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392774]##An enterprise bean must not attempt to listen
on a [#50561028_marker-1503518]##socket, accept connections on a socket,
or use a socket for multicast.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392775]##The EJB architecture allows an enterprise
bean instance to be a network socket client, but it does not allow it to
be a network server. Allowing the instance to become a network server
would conflict with the basic function of the enterprise bean— to serve
the EJB clients.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392776]##The enterprise bean must not attempt to query
a class to obtain information about the declared members that are not
otherwise accessible to the enterprise bean because of the security
rules of the Java language. The enterprise bean must not attempt to use
the [#50561028_marker-1503519]##Reflection API to access information
that the security rules of the Java programming language make
unavailable.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392777]##Allowing the enterprise bean to access
information about other classes and to access the classes in a manner
that is normally disallowed by the Java programming language could
compromise security.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392778]##The enterprise bean must not attempt to
create a [#50561028_marker-1503520]##class loader; set the context class
loader; set security manager; create a new security manager; stop the
[#50561028_marker-1503521]##JVM; or change the input, output, and error
streams.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392779]##These functions are reserved for the EJB
container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions could
compromise security and decrease the container’s ability to properly
manage the runtime environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392780]##The enterprise bean must not attempt to set
the [#50561028_marker-1503522]##socket factory used by ServerSocket,
Socket, or the stream handler factory used by URL.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392781]##These networking functions are reserved for
the EJB container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions
could compromise security and decrease the container’s ability to
properly manage the runtime environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392782]##The enterprise bean must not attempt to
manage threads. The enterprise bean must not attempt to start, stop,
suspend, or resume a thread, or to change a thread’s priority or name.
The enterprise bean must not attempt to manage thread groups.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392783]##These functions are reserved for the EJB
container. Allowing the enterprise bean to manage threads would decrease
the container’s ability to properly manage the runtime environment.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392784]##The enterprise bean must not attempt to
directly read or write a [#50561028_marker-1503523]##file descriptor.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392785]##Allowing the enterprise bean to read and
write file descriptors directly could compromise security.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392786]##The enterprise bean must not attempt to
obtain the [#50561028_marker-1503524]##security policy information for a
particular code source.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392787]##Allowing the enterprise bean to access the

[#50561028_pgfId-1392909]##[#50561028_marker-1392908]##An enterprise
bean’s remote business interfaces and/or remote home and remote
component interfaces are remote interfaces for Java RMI. The container
must ensure the semantics for passing arguments conforms to Java
RMI-IIOP. Non-remote objects must be passed by value.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392910]##Specifically, the EJB container is not
allowed to pass non-remote objects by reference on inter-EJB invocations
when the calling and called enterprise beans are collocated in the same
JVM. Doing so could result in the multiple beans sharing the state of a
Java object, which would break the enterprise bean’s semantics. Any
local optimizations of remote interface calls must ensure the semantics
for passing arguments conforms to Java RMI-IIOP.

[#50561028_pgfId-1392911]##An enterprise bean’s local business
interfaces and/or local home and local interfaces are _local Java
interfaces_ . The caller and callee enterprise beans that make use of
these local interfaces are typically collocated in the same JVM. The EJB
container must ensure the semantics for passing arguments across these
interfaces conforms to the standard argument passing semantics of the
Java programming language.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659014]##This chapter addresses issues of
compatibility and migration between EJB 3.2 and earlier components and
clients.

that do not include entity bean components and JAX-RPC based web
services endpointslink:#pgfId-1705177[124] must be supported to run
unchanged in EJB 3.2 containers.

[#50561028_pgfId-1705181]##Full EJB 3.2 implementations must support EJB
1.1, EJB 2.0, EJB 2.1, EJB 3.0, and EJB 3.1 deployment descriptors for
applications written to earlier versions of the Enterprise JavaBeans
specification. EJB 3.2 Lite implementations must support EJB 3.0, and
EJB 3.1 deployment descriptors for applications written to the EJB 3.x
versions of the Enterprise JavaBeans specification.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1659786]##Default Stateful Session Bean Concurrency Behavior

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1659787]##Prior versions of the EJB specification
allowed the container to choose the default behavior in the event of
concurrent access attempts to a stateful session bean instance. This
specification requires a default of serialized requests in the face of
concurrency. This means by default clients will not receive the
javax.ejb.ConcurrentAccessException when concurrent access occurs for a
request. This should have minimal impact to correctly written
applications since even with the prior behavior there was no guarantee
of receiving such an exception due to the inherent race conditions.
Applications wishing to receive an exception in the face of concurrency
can request that behavior through newly defined metadata. See
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_42519[See Serializing Session Bean Methods] for
more details.

==== [#50561028_pgfId-1659784]##Default Application Exception Subclassing Behavior

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1659798]##The EJB 3.0 Specification was ambiguous with
respect to whether the designation of an unchecked exception as an
application exception applied to that exception’s subclasses. The EJB
3.1 specification clarified that, by default, the application exception
designation is inherited by subclasses. Non-inheriting behavior may be
specified by means of the _ApplicationException_ annotation and/or the
deployment descriptor. See link:Ejb.htm#50561028_34822[See Application
Exceptions] for more detail.

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1659100]##Clients written to the EJB 2.1 and earlier
client view depend upon the existence of a home and component interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659104]##A session bean written to the EJB 3.x API may
be adapted to such earlier preexisting client view interfaces.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659109]##The session bean designates the interfaces to
be adapted by using the RemoteHome and LocalHome metadata annotations on
the bean class (or equivalent deployment descriptor elements). The
corresponding remote and local component interfaces are not explicitly
specified when using these annotations. Rather, they are derived from
the Home and LocalHome interfaces respectively.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659116]##When the client is deployed, the container
classes that implement the EJB 2.1 home and remote component interfaces
(or local home and local component interfaces) referenced by the client
must provide the implementation of the javax.ejb.EJBHome and
javax.ejb.EJBObject interfaces (or the javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and
javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject interfaces) respectively.

[#50561028_pgfId-1659129]##In addition, the container implementation
classes must implement the methods of the home and comonent interfaces

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1659157]##Stateless Session Beans

[#50561028_pgfId-1659158]##The invocation of the home create() method
must return the corresponding local component interface or remote
component interface of the bean. This may or may not cause the creation
of the bean instance, depending on the container’s implementation
strategy. For example, the container may preallocate bean instances
(e.g., in a pooling strategy) or may defer the creation of the bean
instance until the first invocation of a business method on the bean
class. When the bean instance is created, the container invokes the
setSessionContext method, if any, performs any other dependency
injection, and invokes the PostConstruct lifecycle callback methods, if
any, as specified in link:Ejb.htm#50561028_60067[See Session Bean
Creation].

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1659162]##It is likewise
implementation-dependent as to whether the invocation of the EJBHome

[#50561028_pgfId-1659202]##The invocation of the home create<METHOD>()
method causes construction of the bean instance, invocation of the
PostConstruct lifecycle callbacks, if any, and invocation of the

PostConstruct lifecycle callback methods occur in a transaction context
determined by the methods’ transaction attributes, if any.

[#50561028_pgfId-1696751]##The embeddable API is designed to support the
execution of EJB applications within a Java SE environment only. Use of
the javax.ejb.embeddable package is not allowed from an application
running in a Java EE environment. Unlike traditional Java EE
server-based execution, embeddable usage allows client code and its
corresponding enterprise beans to run within the same JVM and class
loader. This provides better support for testing, offline processing
(e.g. batch), and the use of the EJB programming model in desktop
applications.

[#50561028_pgfId-1696769]##Support for the embeddable API is not
required. However, any product that supports the embeddable API must
adhere to the requirements of this specification.

[#50561028_pgfId-1647527]##Embeddable usage requirements allow client
code to instantiate an EJB container that runs within its own JVM and

managed environment with support for the same basic services that exist
within a Java EE runtime: injection, access to a component environment,
container-managed transactions, etc. In general, enterprise bean
components are unaware of the kind of managed environment in which they
are running. This allows maximum reusability of enterprise components
across a wide range of testing and deployment scenarios without
significant rework.

image:Ejb-4.gif[image]

[#50561028_pgfId-1647549]##The embeddable EJB container is instantiated
using a bootstrapping API defined within the javax.ejb package. By
default, the embeddable container uses the JVM class path to scan for
the enterprise bean modules to be initialized. The client can override
this behavior during setup by specifying an alternative set of target
modules.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1647559]##[#50561028_95891]##EJBContainer

[#50561028_pgfId-1647576]##The javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer
abstract class represents an instance of an embeddable container. It
contains factory methods for creating a container instance. The client
initializes a new embeddable container by calling the createEJBContainer
method of the javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1647588]##For example,

[#50561028_pgfId-1647589]##EJBContainer ec =
EJBContainer.createEJBContainer();

[#50561028_pgfId-1648534]##By default, the embeddable container searches
the JVM classpath (the value of the Java System property
java.class.path) to find the set of EJB modules for initialization. A
classpath entry is considered a matching entry if it meets one of the
following criteria:

[#50561028_pgfId-1648535]##It is an ejb-jar according to the standard
module-type identification rules defined by the Java EE platform
specification

[#50561028_pgfId-1648536]##It is a directory containing a
_META-INF/ejb-jar.xml_ file or at least one _.class_ file with an
enterprise bean component-defining annotation

{empty}[#50561028_pgfId-1648537]##Each such matching entry is considered
an EJB module within the same application.link:#pgfId-1672070[126]

[#50561028_pgfId-1649099]##If an _ejb-jar.xml_ file is present the
_module-name_ element defines the module name. Otherwise, for ejb-jar
files, the module name is the unqualified file name excluding the “
_.jar_ ” extension, and for directories the module name is the
unqualified name of the directory (the last name in the pathname’s name
sequence). The embeddable container is not required to support more than
one matching entry with the same module name.

[#50561028_pgfId-1648593]##An alternative form of the createEJBContainer
method provides a set of properties for customizing the embeddable
container creation:

[#50561028_pgfId-1648598]##javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer
createEJBContainer(Map<?, ?> properties)

[#50561028_pgfId-1648564]##This specification reserves the prefix
“javax.ejb.” for standard property names. It is expected that embeddable
Container Providers will define their own properties as well.

[#50561028_pgfId-1648565]##For example, given the following java command
and assuming that foo.jar and bar.jar are both valid ejb-jar files,

[#50561028_pgfId-1648566]##java -classpath
foo.jar:bar.jar:vendor-rt.jar:client.jar

[#50561028_pgfId-1648585]## com.acme.Client

[#50561028_pgfId-1648567]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1648568]##the following will result in only the bar.jar
module being initialized by the container:

[#50561028_pgfId-1650976]##Properties props = new Properties();

[#50561028_pgfId-1650981]##props.setProperty(EJBContainer.MODULES,
"bar");

[#50561028_pgfId-1648571]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1648572]##EJBContainer ec =
EJBContainer.createEJBContainer(props);

[#50561028_pgfId-1647757]##An embeddable Container Provider is permitted
to require that a preprocessing or tooling step be performed on the
application modules prior to JVM initialization.

[#50561028_pgfId-1648720]##After identifying the set of matching
modules, the embeddable container commences application initialization.
Any singleton session beans configured for eager initialization will be
initialized at this point. When the createEJBContainer method returns
successfully, the client can access the client view of any enterprise
bean in the application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1647874]##Enterprise beans running within the
embeddable container are loaded using the context class loader active on
the thread at the time that the createEJBContainer method is called.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1648626]##Standard Initialization Properties

[#50561028_pgfId-1648630]##The following embeddable container
initialization properties are required to be supported by all embeddable
Container Providers.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1648634]##javax.ejb.embeddable.provider

[#50561028_pgfId-1648652]##This property holds a String value that
specifies the fully-qualified name of an embeddable container provider
class corresponding to the embeddable container implementation that
should be used for this application.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651809]##The property name is defined as
EJBContainer.PROVIDER.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1650988]##javax.ejb.embeddable.modules

[#50561028_pgfId-1650992]##This property is used to explicitly specify
the module(s) to be initialized. It can refer to modules that are
included in the JVM classpath or to modules outside the JVM classpath.

[#50561028_pgfId-1658347]##If the target modules are part of the
classpath, this property holds either a single module name (of type
java.lang.String) or an array of module names (of type
java.lang.String[]). For each specified module name, the container
searches the class path for the first eligible ejb-jar file or directory
whose corresponding module name matches the given name. All specified
modules must match an entry in the classpath.

[#50561028_pgfId-1658351]##If the target modules are outside of the
classpath, this property holds either a single java.io.File object or an
array of java.io.File objects, where each file object refers to either
an ejb-jar file or an exploded ejb-jar directory in the format listed
above. Note that in this case it is the responsibility of the caller to
ensure that the context class loader has visibility to the classes
required by these modules.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651815]##The property name is defined as
EJBContainer.MODULES.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1652136]##javax.ejb.embeddable.appName

[#50561028_pgfId-1652140]##This property specifies an application name
for the EJB modules executing within the embeddable container. If
specified, the property value applies to the <app-name> portion of the
portable global JNDI name syntax. It is recommended that this property
be set whenever an embeddable container is executed with more than one
EJB module.

[#50561028_pgfId-1652158]##The property name is defined as
EJBContainer.APP_NAME.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1647779]##Looking Up Session Bean References

[#50561028_pgfId-1647786]##The _EJBContainer_ instance can be used to
retrieve a javax.naming.Context object that supports the lookup of
client references to session beans running within the embeddable
container. Session bean references are identified using the portable
"java:global/" JNDI name syntax defined in section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_97191[See Access in the Global JNDI Namespace].

[#50561028_pgfId-1647787]##A client retrieves a Context object using the
following _EJBContainer_ method:

[#50561028_pgfId-1647800]##javax.naming.Context
EJBContainer.getContext();

[#50561028_pgfId-1647822]##The following example illustrates the lookup
of a FooLocal local business interface of a session bean with ejb-name
FooBean in the ejb-jar foo.jar:

[#50561028_pgfId-1647823]##Context ctx = ec.getContext();

[#50561028_pgfId-1648699]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1652349]##FooLocal foo = (FooLocal)
ctx.lookup("java:global/foo/FooBean");

[#50561028_pgfId-1652350]## 

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1702347]##Embeddable Container Shutdown

[#50561028_pgfId-1702355]##To shut down an embeddable container instance
and its associated application, the client may call the
EJBContainer.close() method or, because the EJBContainer class
implements the java.lang.AutoCloseable interface, the client may close
the container implicitly by using the try-with-resources statement when
aquiring the EJBContainer instance.

[#50561028_pgfId-1702356]##The client is not required to call close() or
use the try-with-resources statement, but their use is recommended for
optimal resource cleanup, especially in the case when the application
lifetime is shorter than the lifetime of the enclosing JVM.

[#50561028_pgfId-1702262]##During the implicit or explicit processing of
the close() method, the embeddable container:

[#50561028_pgfId-1700014]##cancels all non-persistent timers

[#50561028_pgfId-1700015]##cancels all pending asynchronous invocations

[#50561028_pgfId-1700039]##calls the PreDestroy methods of any singleton
session bean instances in the application

[#50561028_pgfId-1664029]##An embeddable Container Provider is only
required to support one active embeddable EJB container at a time per
JVM. Attempts to concurrently create multiple active embeddable EJB
containers may result in a container initialization error.

[#50561028_pgfId-1648004]##This section describes the responsibilities
of the embeddable Container Provider to support an embeddable container
environment.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1647973]##[#50561028_70327]##Runtime Environment

[#50561028_pgfId-1648023]##Except for the packaging requirements, the
embeddable Container Provider is required to support the EJB Lite group
of the EJB API within an embeddable container environment. See section
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_95891[See EJBContainer] for the packaging
requirements. An embeddable Container Provider may additionally support
other EJB API groups within an embeddable container environment. See
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_73802[See EJB Lite and Other EJB API Groups] for
more details.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1648057]##Naming Lookups

[#50561028_pgfId-1648069]##The embeddable Container Provider is required
to support naming lookups of the local and no-interface views of any
session beans defined to run within the embeddable container. Naming
entries for these enterprise beans must conform to the portable global
JNDI name requirements in link:Ejb.htm#50561028_97191[See Access in the
Global JNDI Namespace].

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1651029]##[#50561028_93276]##Embeddable Container Bootstrapping

[#50561028_pgfId-1651038]##An embeddable Container Provider
implementation must act as a service provider by supplying a service
provider configuration file as described in the JAR File Specification
link:Ejb.htm#50561028_54222[See JAR File Specification,
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html.].

[#50561028_pgfId-1651048]##The service provider configuration file
serves to export the embeddable container implementation class to the
EJBContainer bootstrap class, positioning itself as a candidate for
instantiation.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651049]##The embeddable Container Provider supplies
the provider configuration file by creating a text file named
javax.ejb.spi.EJBContainerProvider and placing it in the
META-INF/services directory of one of its JAR files. The contents of the
file must be the name of the embeddable Container Provider
implementation class of the javax.ejb.spi.EJBContainerProvider
interface.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651066]## _Example:_

[#50561028_pgfId-1651067]##An embeddable Container Provider creates a
JAR called acme.jar that contains its embeddable container
implementation. The JAR includes the provider configuration file:

[#50561028_pgfId-1651068]##acme.jar

[#50561028_pgfId-1651078]##
META-INF/services/javax.ejb.spi.EJBContainerProvider

[#50561028_pgfId-1651079]## com/acme/EJBContainerProvider.class

[#50561028_pgfId-1651080]## ...

[#50561028_pgfId-1651081]## 

[#50561028_pgfId-1651082]##The contents of the
META-INF/services/javax.ejb.spi.EJBContainerProvider file is nothing
more than the name of the implementation class:
com.acme.EJBContainerProvider.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651096]##The EJBContainer bootstrap class will locate
all of the embeddable Container Providers by their provider
configuration files and call the
EJBContainerProvider.createEJBContainer(Map<?, ?>) method on them in
turn until an appropriate backing provider returns an EJBContainer
instance. A provider may deem itself as appropriate for the embeddable
application if any of the following are true:

[#50561028_pgfId-1651109]##The javax.ejb.embeddable.provider property
was included in the Map passed to the createEJBContainer method and the
value of the property is the provider’s implementation class.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651113]##No javax.ejb.embeddable.provider property was
specified.

[#50561028_pgfId-1651132]##If a provider does not qualify as the
provider for the embeddable application, it must return null when
createEJBContainer is invoked on it.

====== [#50561028_pgfId-1648082]##Concrete javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer Implementation Class

[#50561028_pgfId-1648729]##The embeddable Container Provider is required
to provide a subclass of the javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer class.
The following are the requirements for this class:

[#50561028_pgfId-1648733]##The class must be defined as public and must
not be abstract

[#50561028_pgfId-1648750]##The class must extend either directly or
indirectly the class javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer

[#50561028_pgfId-1648747]##The class must provide implementations of the
