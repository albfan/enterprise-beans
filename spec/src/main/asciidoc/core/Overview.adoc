== Overview
=== Overall Goals

_The Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) architecture
has the following goals:_

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will be
the standard component architecture for building object-oriented
business applications in the Java(TM) programming language._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
support the development, deployment, and use of distributed business
applications in the Java(TM) programming language._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
support the development, deployment, and use of web services._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
make it easy to write applications: application developers will not have
to understand low-level transaction and state management details,
multi-threading, connection pooling, or other complex low-level APIs._

* _Enterprise JavaBeans applications will follow
the Write Once, Run Anywhere(TM) philosophy of the Java programming
language. An enterprise bean can be developed once, and then deployed on
multiple platforms without recompilation or source code modification._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
address the development, deployment, and runtime aspects of an
enterprise application’s life cycle._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
define the contracts that enable tools from multiple vendors to develop
and deploy components that can interoperate at runtime._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
make it possible to build applications by combining components developed
using tools from different vendors._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will
provide interoperability between enterprise beans and Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition (Java EE) components as well as non-Java programming
language applications._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will be
compatible with existing server platforms. Vendors will be able to
extend their existing products to support Enterprise JavaBeans._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will be
compatible with other Java programming language APIs._

* _The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture will be
compatible with the CORBA protocols._

The purpose of the EJB 3.2 release is both to
continue to achieve these goals and to improve the EJB architecture by
reducing its complexity from the enterprise application developer’s
point of view.

=== EJB Roles

_The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture defines
six distinct roles in the application development and deployment life
cycle. Each EJB role may be performed by a different party. The EJB
architecture specifies the contracts that ensure that the product of
each EJB role is compatible with the product of the other EJB roles. The
EJB specification focuses on those contracts that are required to
support the development and deployment of enterprise beans._

****
_In some scenarios, a single party may perform
several EJB Roles. For example, the Container Provider and the EJB
Server Provider may be the same vendor. Or a single programmer may
perform the two EJB Roles of the Enterprise Bean Provider and the
Application Assembler._
****

_The following sections define the six EJB
roles.footnote:a10218[Earlier releases of this specification 
distinguished a seventh role, that of the persistence provider. 
The role of the persistence provider is independent of that of 
the EJB specification, which assumes that a Java Persistence 
implementation may be pluggable. See <<a9851>>.]_

==== Enterprise Bean Provider

The Enterprise
Bean Provider (Bean Provider for short) is the producer of enterprise
beans. His or her output is a set of one or more enterprise beans. These
beans may be contained in a ejb-jar
or may be contained directly in a `.war` file.
The Bean Provider is responsible for the Java classes that implement the
enterprise beans’ business methods; the definition of the beans’ client
view interfaces, if any; and the declarative specification of the beans’
metadata. The beans’ metadata may take the form of metadata annotations
applied to the bean classes and/or an external XML deployment
descriptor. The beans’ metadata—whether expressed in metadata
annotations or in the deployment descriptor—includes the structural
information of the enterprise beans and declares all the enterprise
beans’ external dependencies (e.g. the names and types of resources that
the enterprise beans use).

_The Enterprise Bean Provider is typically an
application domain expert. The Bean Provider develops reusable
enterprise beans that typically implement business tasks or business
entities._

_The Bean Provider is not required to be an
expert at system-level programming. Therefore, the Bean Provider usually
does not program transactions, concurrency, security, distribution, or
other services into the enterprise beans. The Bean Provider relies on
the EJB container for these services._

_A Bean Provider of multiple enterprise beans
often performs the EJB role of the Application Assembler._

==== Application Assembler

The Application
Assembler combines enterprise beans into larger deployable application
units. The input to the Application Assembler is a set of enterprise
beans, their interfaces, and metadata, as produced by the Bean
Provider(s). The Bean Provider's output may also simply be un-assembled
enterprise beans that must be packaged in an ejb-jar file or `.war`
file. The Application Assembler may insert the application assembly
instructions into the deployment descriptors. The Application Assembler
will create one or more ejb-jar and/or `.war` files from the input
artifacts together with their application assembly instructions as
needed.

All of the input could be combined into a
single output ejb-jar file or `.war` file. Similarly, the input could
also be split into multiple output ejb-jar and/or `.war` files. For
example, the Application Assembler could combine ejb1.jar and ejb2.jar
into ejb3.jar, combine ejb1.jar and web1.war into web2.war, split
ejb1.jar into ejb2.jar and ejb3.jar, split web1.war into ejb1.jar and
web2.jar, and so forth. Each output ejb-jar file or `.war` file is
either a deployment unit intended for the Deployer or a partially
assembled application that is intended for another Application
Assembler.

The Application Assembler can also combine
enterprise beans with other types of application components when
composing an application.

The EJB specification describes the case in
which the application assembly step occurs before the deployment of the
enterprise beans. However, the EJB architecture does not preclude the
case that application assembly is performed after the deployment of all
or some of the enterprise beans.

_The Application Assembler is a domain expert
who composes applications that use enterprise beans. The Application
Assembler works with the enterprise beans’ metadata annotations and/or
deployment descriptor and the enterprise beans’ client-view contract.
Although the Assembler must be familiar with the functionality provided
by the enterprise beans’ client-view, he or she does not need to have
any knowledge of the enterprise beans’ implementation._

==== Deployer

The Deployer
takes one or more ejb-jar files and/or .war file produced by a Bean
Provider or Application Assembler and deploys the enterprise beans
contained in the ejb-jar files or .war files in a specific operational
environment. The operational environment includes an EJB container and
server.

The Deployer must resolve all the external
dependencies declared by the Bean Provider (e.g. the Deployer must
ensure that all resource manager connection factories used by the
enterprise beans are present in the operational environment, and he or
she must bind them to the resource manager connection factory references
declared in the metadata annotations or deployment descriptor), and must
follow the application assembly instructions defined by the Application
Assembler. To perform his or her role, the Deployer uses tools provided
by the EJB Container Provider.

The Deployer’s output is a set of enterprise
beans (or an assembled application that includes enterprise beans) that
have been customized for the target operational environment, and that
are deployed in a specific EJB container.

_The Deployer is an expert at a specific
operational environment and is responsible for the deployment of
enterprise beans. For example, the Deployer is responsible for mapping
the security roles defined by the Bean Provider or Application Assembler
to the user groups and accounts that exist in the operational
environment in which the enterprise beans are deployed._

_The Deployer uses tools supplied by the EJB
Container Provider to perform the deployment tasks. The deployment
process is typically two-stage:_

* _The Deployer first generates the additional
classes and interfaces that enable the container to manage the
enterprise beans at runtime. These classes are container-specific._

* _The Deployer performs the actual installation
of the enterprise beans and the additional classes and interfaces into
the EJB container._

_In some cases, a qualified Deployer may
customize the business logic of the enterprise beans at their
deployment. Such a Deployer would typically use the Container Provider’s
tools to write relatively simple application code that wraps the
enterprise beans’ business methods._

==== EJB Server Provider

_The EJB Server
Provider is a specialist in the area of distributed transaction
management, distributed objects, and other lower-level system-level
services._

_The current EJB architecture assumes that the
EJB Server Provider and the EJB Container Provider roles are the same
vendor. Therefore, it does not define any interface requirements for the
EJB Server Provider._

==== EJB Container Provider

The EJB Container
Provider (Container Provider for short) provides:

* The deployment tools necessary for the
deployment of enterprise beans.

* The runtime support for the deployed
enterprise bean instances.

From the perspective of the enterprise beans,
the container is a part of the target operational environment. The
container runtime provides the deployed enterprise beans with
transaction and security management, network distribution of remote
clients, scalable management of resources, and other services that are
generally required as part of a manageable server platform.

The "EJB Container Provider’s
responsibilities" defined by the EJB architecture are meant to be
requirements for the implementation of the EJB container and server.
Since the EJB specification does not architect the interface between the
EJB container and server, it is left up to the vendor how to split the
implementation of the required functionality between the EJB container
and server.

_The expertise of the Container Provider is
system-level programming, possibly combined with some application-domain
expertise. The focus of a Container Provider is on the development of a
scalable, secure, transaction-enabled container that is integrated with
an EJB server. The Container Provider insulates the enterprise bean from
the specifics of an underlying EJB server by providing a simple,
standard API between the enterprise bean and the container. This API is
the Enterprise JavaBeans component contract._

_The Container Provider typically provides
support for versioning the installed enterprise bean components. For
example, the Container Provider may allow enterprise bean classes to be
upgraded without invalidating existing clients or losing existing
enterprise bean objects._

_The Container Provider typically provides
tools that allow the System Administrator to monitor and manage the
container and the beans running in the container at runtime._

==== System Administrator

The System
Administrator is responsible for the configuration and administration of
the enterprise’s computing and networking infrastructure that includes
the EJB server and container. The System Administrator is also
responsible for overseeing the well-being of the deployed enterprise
beans applications at runtime.

=== Enterprise Beans

Enterprise JavaBeans is an architecture for
component-based transaction-oriented enterprise applications.

==== Characteristics of Enterprise Beans

The essential
characteristics of an enterprise bean are:

* An enterprise bean typically contains
business logic that operates on the enterprise’s data.

* An enterprise bean’s instances are managed at
runtime by a container.

* An enterprise bean can be customized at
deployment time by editing its environment entries.

* Various service information, such as
transaction and security attributes, may be specified together with the
business logic of the enterprise bean class in the form of metadata
annotations, or separately, in an XML deployment descriptor. This
service information may be extracted and managed by tools during
application assembly and deployment.

* Client access is mediated by the container in
which the enterprise bean is deployed.

* If an enterprise bean uses only the services
defined by the EJB specification, the enterprise bean can be deployed in
any compliant EJB container. Specialized containers can provide
additional services beyond those defined by the EJB specification. An
enterprise bean that depends on such a service can be deployed only in a
container that supports that service.

* An enterprise bean can be included in an
assembled application without requiring source code changes or
recompilation of the enterprise bean.

* The Bean Provider defines a client view of an
enterprise bean. The Bean Provider can manually define the client view
or it can be generated automatically by application development tools.
The client view is unaffected by the container and server in which the
bean is deployed. This ensures that both the beans and their clients can
be deployed in multiple execution environments without changes or
recompilation.

==== Flexible Model

The enterprise bean architecture is flexible
enough to implement the following:

* An object that represents a stateless
service.

* An object that represents a stateless service
and that implements a web service endpoint.

* An object that represents a stateless service
and whose invocation is asynchronous, driven by the arrival of messages.

* An object that represents a conversational
session with a particular client. Such session objects automatically
maintain their conversational state across multiple client-invoked
methods.

Enterprise beans
that are remotely accessible components are intended to be relatively
coarse-grained business objects or services (e.g. shopping cart, stock
quote service). In general, fine-grained objects should not be modeled
as remotely accessible components.

_Although the state management protocol
defined by the Enterprise JavaBeans architecture is simple, it provides
an enterprise bean developer great flexibility in managing a bean’s
state._

=== Enterprise Bean Object Types

The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture defines
the following types of enterprise bean objects:

* Session objects.

* Message-driven objects.

* Entity objects (optional).

Support for session objects and
message-driven objects is required by this specification.

_Earlier versions of the Enterprise JavaBeans
specification required support for entity bean *components* (not to be
confused with the light-weight persistent entities defined by the Java
Persistence API). Support for entity bean components has been made
optional for an implementation as of the 3.2 version of the EJB
specification and is described in the EJB Optional Features document
<<a9890>>._

==== Session Objects

_A typical session
object has the following characteristics:_

* _Executes on behalf of a single client._

* _Can be transaction-aware._

* _Updates shared data in an underlying
database._

* _Does not represent directly shared data in
the database, although it may access and update such data._

* _May be relatively short-lived, or may have
the same lifetime as that of the application._

* _Is removed when the EJB container crashes.
The client has to re-establish a new session object to continue
computation._

_A typical EJB container provides a scalable
runtime environment to execute a large number of session objects
concurrently._

_The EJB specification defines *stateful*,
*stateless*, and *singleton* session beans. There are differences in the API
between stateful session beans, stateless session beans, and singleton
session beans._

==== Message-Driven Objects

_A typical
message-driven object has the following
characteristics:_

* _Executes upon receipt of a single client
message._

* _Is asynchronously invoked._

* _Can be transaction-aware._

* _May update shared data in an underlying
database._

* _Does not represent directly shared data in
the database, although it may access and update such data._

* _Is relatively short-lived._

* _Is stateless._

* _Is removed when the EJB container crashes.
The container has to re-establish a new message-driven object to
continue computation._

_A typical EJB container provides a scalable
runtime environment to execute a large number of message-driven objects
concurrently._

==== Entity Objects (Optional)

_A typical entity
object has the following characteristics:_

* _Is part of a domain model, providing an
object view of data in the database._

* _Can be long-lived (lives as long as the data
in the database)._

* _The entity and its primary key survive the
crash of the EJB container. If the state of an entity was being updated
by a transaction at the time the container crashed, the entity’s state
is restored to the state of the last committed transaction when the
entity is next retrieved._

_See the EJB Optional Features <<a9890>> document for details._

=== Standard Mapping to CORBA Protocols

To help
interoperability for EJB environments that include systems from multiple
vendors, the EJB specification requires compliant implementations to
support the interoperability protocol based on CORBA/IIOP for remote
invocations from Java EE clients. Implementations may support other
remote invocation protocols in addition to IIOP.

<<a3308>> summarizes the requirements
for support for distribution and interoperability.

[[a179]]
=== Mapping to Web Service Protocols

To support web service interoperability, the
EJB specification requires compliant implementations to support
XML-based web service invocations using WSDL and SOAP or plain XML over
HTTP in conformance with the requirements of the JAX-WS
<<a9881>>, Web Services for Java EE <<a9879>>, and Web
Services Metadata for the Java Platform <<a9878>> specifications.

Support for web services invocations using
JAX-RPC <<a9873>> is optional
as of the 3.2 release of the Enterprise JavaBeans specification. See the
EJB Optional Features document <<a9890>> for the complete
description.

[[a182]]
=== Pruning the EJB API

The Java EE 6 Specification adopted the
process defined by the Java SE group for "pruning" technologies from the
platform in a careful and orderly way that minimizes the impact to
developers using these technologies while allowing the platform to grow
even stronger.

The result of pruning a feature is not the
actual deletion of the feature but rather the conversion of the feature
from a required part of the EJB API into an optional part of the EJB
API. No actual removal from the specification occurs, although the
feature may be removed from products at the choice of the product
vendor.

Support for the following features has been
made optional in the Enterprise JavaBeans specification as of the 3.2
release and the content of the related chapters had been moved to the
separate EJB Optional Features document <<a9890>>. An
implementation of this specification is therefore not required to
support any of these features. However, if an implementation chooses to
implement an optional feature, it must do so in accordance with the
requirements of this specification.

* EJB 2.1 and earlier Entity Bean Component
Contract for Container-Managed Persistence

* EJB 2.1 and earlier Entity Bean Component
Contract for Bean-Managed Persistence

* Client View of an EJB 2.1 and earlier Entity
Bean

* EJB QL: EJB Query Language for
Container-Managed Persistence Query Methods

* JAX-RPC Based Web Service Endpoints

* JAX-RPC Web Service Client View

=== Relationship to Managed Bean Specification

The _Managed Beans Specification_
<<a9886>> defines the minimal
requirements for container-managed objects, otherwise known under the
acronym "POJOs" (Plain Old Java Objects), within the Java EE Platform.
Managed Beans support a small set of basic services, such as resource
injection, lifecycle callbacks and interceptors.

A session bean component is a Managed Bean.
The EJB component model extends the basic _Managed Bean_ model in many
areas (component definition, naming, lifecycle, threading, etc.)

[[a195]]
=== Relationship to Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) Specification

The _Context and Dependency Injection
Specification_ <<a9888>> provides a uniform framework for
the dependency injection and lifecycle management of "managed beans" and
adds contextual lifecycle management to the EJB component model.

An EJB packaged into a CDI bean archive and
not annotated with `javax.enterprise.inject.Vetoed` annotation, is
considered a CDI-enabled bean. The CDI container performs dependency
injection on all instances of CDI-enabled session and message-driven
beans, even those which are not contextual instances:

* A session bean instance obtained via
dependency injection is a contextual instance, i.e. it is bound to a
lifecycle context and is available to other objects that execute in the
same context

* A message-driven bean instance is always
non-contextual, i.e. it may not be injected into other objects.

=== Relationship to the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) Specification

The _Java API for RESTful Web Services Specification_ <<a9889>>
defines a set of Java APIs for the development of Web services built
according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural
style.

The JAX-RS API provides a set of annotations
and associated classes and interfaces that may be used to expose beans
as Web resources.

In a product that supports the JAX-RS
specification, stateless and singleton session beans must be supported
as root resource classes, providers, and `javax.ws.rs.core.Application`
subclasses. JAX-RS annotations may be applied to a session bean class,
methods of a session bean’s no-interface view, or a session bean’s local
business interface.
