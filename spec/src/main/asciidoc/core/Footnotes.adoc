[.footnoteNumber]# 1.# [[a10218]]Earlier releases of
this specification distinguished a seventh role, that of the persistence
provider. The role of the persistence provider is independent of that of
the EJB specification, which assumes that a Java Persistence
implementation may be pluggable. See link:Ejb.html#a9851[See
Java™ Persistence API, version 2.1.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 2.# [[a10219]]More literally,
references are passed by value in the JVM: an argument variable of
primitive type holds a value of that primitive type; an argument
variable of a reference type hold a reference to the object. See
link:Ejb.html#a9876[See The Java Virtual Machine
Specification.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 3.# [[a10220]]This may not apply to
stateless session beans; see link:Ejb.html#a1065[See Stateless
Session Beans].

[.footnoteNumber]# 4.# [[a10221]]Note that the EJB 3.x
session bean business interface is not an EJBObject. It is not valid to
pass a reference to the remote business interface through a bean’s
remote component interface.

[.footnoteNumber]# 5.# [[a10222]] It is part of the
logic of an application designed using stateful session beans to
designate a method that causes the removal of the stateful session (and
thus allows for the reclamation of resources used by the session bean).
This example assumes that the _finishShopping_ method is such a _Remove_
method. See link:Ejb.html#a921[See Stateful Session Beans] for
further discussion.

[.footnoteNumber]# 6.# [[a10223]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends java.rmi.Remote,
the java.rmi.RemoteExcep-

tion is received instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 7.# [[a10225]]This may not apply to
stateless session beans; see link:Ejb.html#a1065[See Stateless
Session Beans].

[.footnoteNumber]# 8.# [[a10226]]This may not apply to
stateless session beans; see link:Ejb.html#a1065[See Stateless
Session Beans].

[.footnoteNumber]# 9.# [[a10227]]Use of
javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow is not needed when the EJBContext
lookup method is used to look up the remote home interface.

[.footnoteNumber]# 10.# [[a10228]]Note that this
requirement does not apply to the EntityManager and EntityManagerFactory
objects.

[.footnoteNumber]# 11.# [[a10229]]The container is not
permitted to destroy a stateful session bean instance because it does
not meet these requirements.

[.footnoteNumber]# 12.# [[a10230]]Note that the Java
Serialization protocol dynamically determines whether or not an object
is serializable. This means that it is possible to serialize an object
of a serializable subclass of a non-serializable declared field type.

[.footnoteNumber]# 13.#
[[a10231]]Component contract and
client view of entity beans are described in the EJB Optional Features
document link:Ejb.html#a9890[See EJB 3.2 Optional Features
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=345.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 14.# [[a10232]]Except for the
_javax.mail.Session_  resource manager
connection factory.

[.footnoteNumber]# 15.# [[a10234]]This is to allow the
container to swap out an instance’s state through techniques other than
the Java Serialization protocol. For example, the container’s Java
Virtual Machine implementation may use a block of memory to keep the
instance’s variables, and the container swaps the whole memory block to
the disk instead of performing Java Serialization on the instance.

[.footnoteNumber]# 16.# [[a10235]]Any initialization
methods defined for the bean by means of the _init-method_ deployment
descriptor element apply in addition to those defined by means of
annotations.

[.footnoteNumber]# 17.# [[a10236]]Any remove methods
defined for the bean by means of the _remove-method_ deployment
descriptor element apply in addition to those defined by means of
annotations.

[.footnoteNumber]# 18.# [[a10237]]The concurrency
management type CONTAINER may be specified for stateful session beans,
but doing so has no impact on the semantics of concurrency management
for such beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 19.# [[a10238]]The
_javax.ejb.ConcurrentAccessException_ is a subclass of the
_javax.ejb.EJBException_ . If the business interface is a remote
business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_ , the client will
receive the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 20.# [[a10239]]Note that the
existence of global JNDI names for the local and no-interface client
views does not imply that cross-application access to those entries is
required. See link:Ejb.html#a242[See Local Clients] for more
details.

[.footnoteNumber]# 21.# [[a10240]]If an
_AroundConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the
stateful session bean, the container follows the rules for the
_AroundConstruct interceptors_ defined in the Interceptors specification
link:Ejb.html#a9887[See Interceptors, version 1.2.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 22.# [[a10241]]If
a stateful session bean lifecycle callback interceptor method is invoked
in the scope of a transaction, session synchronization callbacks for
such transactions are not called on the bean instance — see section
link:Ejb.html#a2750[See Session Synchronization Callbacks].

[.footnoteNumber]# 23.# [[a10242]]Note that if the Java
Persistence API is used, the persistence provider will use the
beforeCompletion notification to automatically flush any updates to the
container-managed persistence context to the database. See
link:Ejb.html#a9851[See Java™ Persistence API, version 2.1.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 24.# [[a10243]]If
the business interface is a remote business interface that extends
_java.rmi.Remote_ , the _java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ is thrown to
the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 25.# [[a10244]]If
the _Remove_ annotation specifies the value of _retainIfException_ as
_true_ , and the _Remove_ method throws an application exception, the
instance is not removed (and the _PreDestroy_ lifecycle callback
interceptor methods are not invoked).

[.footnoteNumber]# 26.# [[a10245]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 27.# [[a10246]]If a client calls
lifecycle callback method through a business interface or a no-interface
view, the method is treated like a business method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 28.# [[a10247]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 29.# [[a10248]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 30.# [[a10249]]If an
_AroundConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the
stateless session bean, the container follows the rules for the
_AroundConstruct interceptors_ defined in the Interceptors specification
link:Ejb.html#a9887[See Interceptors, version 1.2.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 31.# [[a10250]]If a client calls
lifecycle callback method through a business interface or a no-interface
view, the method is treated like a business method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 32.# [[a10251]]If an
_AroundConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the
singleton session bean, the container follows the rules for the
_AroundConstruct interceptors_ defined in the Interceptors specification
link:Ejb.html#a9887[See Interceptors, version 1.2.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 33.# [[a10252]]If a client calls
lifecycle callback method through a business interface or a no-interface
view, the method is treated like a business method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 34.# [[a10253]]Note that the
interfaces provided by the Bean Provider may have been generated by
tools.

[.footnoteNumber]# 35.# [[a10254]]Note that the EJB 2.x
client view is not supported for singleton session beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 36.# [[a10255]]Except for singleton
session beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 37.# [[a10256]]Note that this might
result from the use of default interceptors, for example.

[.footnoteNumber]# 38.# [[a10257]]It is also an error
if the _Local_ and/or _Remote_ annotations are specified both on the
bean class and on the referenced interface and the values differ.

[.footnoteNumber]# 39.# [[a10258]]If _PrePassivate_ or
_PostActivate_ lifecycle callbacks are defined for message-driven beans,
they are ignored.

[.footnoteNumber]# 40.# [[a10259]]If an
_AroundConstruct_ lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the
message-driven bean, the container follows the rules for the
_AroundConstruct interceptors_ defined in the Interceptors specification
link:Ejb.html#a9887[See Interceptors, version 1.2.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=318.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 41.# [[a10260]]This might result
from the use of default interceptor classes, for example.

[.footnoteNumber]# 42.# [[a10261]]This restriction may
be removed in a future release of this specification.

{empty}[.footnoteNumber]# 43.# [[a10262]]See
link:Ejb.html#a1254[See Singleton Session Bean Error Handling]

[.footnoteNumber]# 44.# [[a10263]]Note that environment
entries other than resources are specified with the _Resource_
annotation and/or resource-ref deployment descriptor element as well.

[.footnoteNumber]# 45.# [[a10264]]In this chapter we
use the _TransactionAttribute_ annotation values to refer to transaction
attributes. The deployment descriptor may be used as an overriding
mechanism or an alternative to the use of annotations.

[.footnoteNumber]# 46.# [[a10265]]The use of the term
“container” here encompasses both the container and the messaging
provider. When the contracts outlined in link:Ejb.html#a9863[See
Java EE™ Connector Architecture, version 1.7 (Connector).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322.] are used, it may be the messaging
provider that starts the transaction.

[.footnoteNumber]# 47.# [[a10266]]This restriction may
be removed in a future release of this specification.

[.footnoteNumber]# 48.# [[a10267]]However, use of the
Java Persistence API _EntityTransaction_ interface is supported. See
link:Ejb.html#a9851[See Java™ Persistence API, version 2.1.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338.] for a discussion of resources used
in the Java Persistence API that may be “unaware” of the presence of JTA
transactions, and a description of the EntityTransaction interface and
its use.

[.footnoteNumber]# 49.# [[a10268]]Note that the Bean
Provider must use the pre-passivate callback method here to close the
connections and set the instance variables for the connection to null.

[.footnoteNumber]# 50.# [[a10269]]REQUIRED is the
default transaction attribute value for container managed transaction
demarcation. The explicit specification of the transaction attribute is
therefore not required in this example.

[.footnoteNumber]# 51.# [[a10270]]If a stateful session
bean's PostConstruct, PreDestroy, PrePassivate or PostActivate lifecycle
callback interceptor methods are invoked in the scope of a transaction,
SessionSynchronization callbacks for such transactions are not called on
the bean instance.

[.footnoteNumber]# 52.# [[a10271]]However, use of the
Java Persistence API _EntityTransaction_ interface is supported. See
link:Ejb.html#a9851[See Java™ Persistence API, version 2.1.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338.] for a discussion of resources used
in the Java Persistence API that may be “unaware” of the presence of JTA
transactions, and a description of the _EntityTransaction_ interface and
its use

[.footnoteNumber]# 53.# [[a10272]]The container
typically relies on a transaction manager that is part of the EJB server
to perform the two-phase commit across all the enlisted resource
managers. If only a single resource manager is involved in the
transaction and the deployment descriptor indicates that connection
sharing may be used, the container may use the local transaction
optimization. See link:Ejb.html#a9861[See Java™ Platform,
Enterprise Edition Specification Version 7 (Java EE).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342.] and
link:Ejb.html#a9863[See Java EE™ Connector Architecture, version
1.7 (Connector). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322.] for further
discussion.

[.footnoteNumber]# 54.# [[a10273]]Note that if the bean
is a singleton session bean, the instance must not be discarded unless
the exception occurred in an AroundConstruct, _PostConstruct_ or
_PreDestroy_ lifecycle interceptor method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 55.# [[a10274]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 56.# [[a10275]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _javax.transaction.TransactionRequiredException_ is thrown to the
client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 57.# [[a10276]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ is thrown to the client instead.

an asynchronous method.

http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=345.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 62.# [[a10281]]This diamond problem
applies only to the case when B and C are in the same transaction.

[.footnoteNumber]# 63.# [[a10282]]This may not be the
case where web services protocols are used. See
link:Ejb.html#a9873[See Java™ API for XML-based RPC, version 1.1
(JAX-RPC). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=101.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 64.# [[a10283]]If a transaction had
been marked for rollback, the value of the rollback element has no
effect.

[.footnoteNumber]# 65.# [[a10284]]Note that the
enterprise bean business method may attempt to recover from a
_RemoteException_ . The text in this subsection applies only to the case
when the business method does not wish to recover from the
_RemoteException_ .

[.footnoteNumber]# 66.# [[a10285]]A checked exception
is one that is not a subclass of java.lang.RuntimeException.

[.footnoteNumber]# 67.# [[a10286]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 68.# [[a10287]]The caller can be
another enterprise bean or an arbitrary client program.

[.footnoteNumber]# 69.# [[a10288]]Log the exception or
error means that the container logs the exception or error so that the
System Administrator is alerted of the problem.

[.footnoteNumber]# 70.# [[a10289]]Discard instance
means that the container must not invoke any business methods or
container callbacks on the instance. Discarding does not apply if the
bean is a singleton session bean.

[.footnoteNumber]# 71.# [[a10290]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends java.rmi.Remote,
the javax.transaction.TransactionRolledbackException is thrown to the
client, which will receive this exception.

[.footnoteNumber]# 72.# [[a10291]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends java.rmi.Remote,
the java.rmi.RemoteException is thrown to the client, which will receive
this exception.

[.footnoteNumber]# 73.# [[a10292]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends java.rmi.Remote,
the java.rmi.RemoteException is thrown to the client, which will receive
this exception.

[.footnoteNumber]# 74.# [[a10293]]Discarding does not
apply if the bean is a singleton session bean.

[.footnoteNumber]# 75.# [[a10294]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends java.rmi.Remote,
the java.rmi.RemoteException is thrown to the client, which will receive
this exception.



[.footnoteNumber]# 76.# [[a10296]]The caller can be
another enterprise bean or an arbitrary client program. This case is not
applicable for methods of the web service endpoint.

[.footnoteNumber]# 77.# [[a10297]]Log the exception or
error means that the container logs the exception or error so that the
System Administrator is alerted of the problem.

[.footnoteNumber]# 78.# [[a10298]]Discard instance
means that the container must not invoke any business methods or
container callbacks on the instance. Discarding does not apply if the
bean is a singleton session bean.

[.footnoteNumber]# 79.# [[a10299]]Throw
_RemoteException_ to web service client means that the container maps
the _RemoteException_ to the appropriate SOAP fault. See
link:Ejb.html#a9873[See Java™ API for XML-based RPC, version 1.1
(JAX-RPC). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=101.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 80.# [[a10300]]Discarding does not
apply if the bean is a singleton session bean.

[.footnoteNumber]# 81.# [[a10301]]Throw
_RemoteException_ to web service client means that the container maps
the _RemoteException_ to the appropriate SOAP fault. See
link:Ejb.html#a9873[See Java™ API for XML-based RPC, version 1.1
(JAX-RPC). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=101.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 82.# [[a10302]]Log the exception or
error means that the container logs the exception or error so that the
System Administrator is alerted of the problem.

[.footnoteNumber]# 83.# [[a10303]]Discard instance
means that the container must not invoke any methods on the instance.

[.footnoteNumber]# 84.# [[a10304]]Log the exception or
error means that the container logs the exception or error so that the
System Administrator is alerted of the problem.

[.footnoteNumber]# 85.# [[a10305]]Discard instance
means that the container must not invoke any methods on the instance.
Discarding does not apply if the bean is a singleton session bean.

[.footnoteNumber]# 86.# [[a10306]]Log the exception or
error means that the container logs the exception or error so that the
System Administrator is alerted of the problem.

[.footnoteNumber]# 87.# [[a10307]]Discard instance
means that the container must not invoke any methods on the instance.
Discarding does not apply if the bean is a singleton session bean.

[.footnoteNumber]# 88.# [[a10308]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 89.# [[a10309]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _javax.transaction.TransactionRolledbackException_ is thrown to
the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 90.# [[a10310]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 91.# [[a10311]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_

[[a10313]]Component contract and
client view of entity beans are described in the EJB Optional Features
document link:Ejb.html#a9890[See EJB 3.2 Optional Features

[.footnoteNumber]# 94.# [[a10314]]CORBA APIs and
earlier versions of the IIOP protocol are already included in the J2SE
1.2, J2SE 1.3 and J2EE 1.2 platforms through JavaIDL and RMI-IIOP.

[.footnoteNumber]# 97.# [[a10317]]One way to include
the tagged components in IORs is to create the object references using a
Portable Object Adapter (POA) which is initialized with the appropriate
transaction policies. Note that POA APIs are not required to be
supported by server containers.

[.footnoteNumber]# 98.# [[a10318]]If the
InvocationPolicy is not present in the IOR, it is interpreted by the
client as if the policy value was _CosTransactions::EITHER_ .

[.footnoteNumber]# 99.# [[a10319]]When there are
concurrent invocations on a component from multiple clients, a different
principal may be associated with the thread of execution for each
invocation.

[.footnoteNumber]# 100.# [[a10320]]One way to achieve
this is to configure a “trusted container list” for each EJB container
which contains the list of intermediate client containers that are
trusted. If the list is empty, then the target EJB container does not
have a trust relationship with any intermediate container.

[.footnoteNumber]# 101.# [[a10321]]This ciphersuite is
mandatory for compliant TLS implementations as specified in

[.footnoteNumber]# 102.# [[a10322]]The term “resource”
is used generically in this chapter to refer to these other environment
entries as resources as well. Resources in the non-generic sense are
described in section link:Ejb.html#a4159[See Resource Manager
Connection Factory References].

[.footnoteNumber]# 110.# [[a10330]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.AccessException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 111.# [[a10331]]For example, the
enterprise bean may be installed each time using a different bean name
(as specified by means of the deployment descriptor).

[.footnoteNumber]# 112.# [[a10332]]The calendar-based
timer and non-persistent timer functionality is not supported for 2.1
Entity beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 113.# [[a10333]]This functionality
may be added in a future release of this specification.

[.footnoteNumber]# 114.# [[a10334]]In the event of race
conditions, extraneous calls to the timeout callback method may occur.

[.footnoteNumber]# 115.# [[a10335]]Note that annotation
java.lang.String attributes use the empty string ““ as a default, so the
expression @Schedule(timezone=””, ...) will result in a null value from
the corresponding ScheduleExpression.getTimezone() method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 116.# [[a10336]]Note that the
default value of the _info_ element of the _Schedule_ annotation is the
empty string "" . The expression _@Schedule(info=_ "" _, ...)_ will also
result in a null value from the timer’s _getInfo()_ method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 117.# [[a10337]]There is currently
no way to set the information object after timer creation. An API to do
this may be added in a future release of this specification.

[.footnoteNumber]# 118.# [[a10338]]This method may be
specified on the bean class or on a superclass. If the _Timeout_
annotation is used or the bean implements the _TimedObject_ interface,
the _timeout-method_ deployment descriptor element, if specified, can
only be used to refer to the same method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 119.# [[a10339]]If the bean
implements the _TimedObject_ interface, the _Timeout_ annotation may
optionally be applied to the _ejbTimeout_ method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 120.# [[a10340]]An earlier version
of the specification required that timeout callbacks accept the _Timer_
parameter but did not require that this parameter be listed when
declared by means of the deployment descriptor. To preserve backward
compatibility, a _timeout-method_ that does not include a _method-param_
element for the _javax.ejb.Timer_ parameter may be used to match either
a timeout method signature with or without a Timer parameter, if there
is only one method with the specified name. If methods with the
specified name are overloaded, a timeout-method element with an empty
method-params element will be used to explicitly refer to a the no-arg
timeout method.

[.footnoteNumber]# 121.# [[a10341]]The
concurrency-management-type Container may be specified for stateful
session beans, but doing so has no impact on the semantics of
concurrency management for such beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 122.# [[a10342]]This permission is
necessary, for example, to allow enterprise beans to use the client
functionality of the Java IDL and RMI-IIOP packages that are part of the
Java 2 platform.

[.footnoteNumber]# 123.# [[a10343]]This restriction may
be removed in a future release of this specification.

unspecified if data aliasing occurs.

[.footnoteNumber]# 126.# [[a10346]]Support for more
than one module is required for a Full Java EE platform product.
Multi-module support is only required for Java EE profiles that require
support for .ear files.
