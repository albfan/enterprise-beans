== Persistence

The model for persistence and
object/relational mapping was considerably revised and enhanced in the
Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 release. The contracts and requirements for
persistent entities are defined by the "_Java Persistence API_"
specification <<a9851>>, which also contains
the full specification of the Java Persistence query language and the
metadata for object/relational mapping.
