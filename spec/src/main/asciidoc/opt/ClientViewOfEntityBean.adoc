== Client View of an Entity Bean

This chapter describes the client view of an
entity bean. It is actually a contract fulfilled by the container in
which the entity bean is deployed. Only the business methods are
supplied by the enterprise bean itself.

Although the client view of the deployed
entity beans is provided by classes implemented by the container, the
container itself is transparent to the client.

=== Overview



For a client, an
entity bean is a component that represents an object-oriented view of
some entities stored in a persistent storage, such as a database, or
entities that are implemented by an existing enterprise application.

The client of an
entity bean may be a local client or the
client may be a remote client.

This section provides an overview of the
entity bean client view that is independent of whether the client is a
remote client or a local client. The differences between remote clients
and local clients are discussed in the following sections.

From its creation until its destruction, an
entity object lives in a container. Transparently to the client, the
container provides security, concurrency, transactions, persistence, and
other services for the entity objects that live in the container. The
container is transparent to the client—there is no API that a client can
use to manipulate the container.

Multiple clients can access an entity object
concurrently. The container in which the entity bean is deployed
properly synchronizes access to the entity object’s state using
transactions.

Each entity
object has an identity which, in general, survives a crash and restart
of the container in which the entity object has been created. The object
identity is implemented by the container with the cooperation of the
enterprise bean class.

Multiple enterprise beans can be deployed in
a container. For each entity bean deployed in a container, the container
provides a class that implements a home interface for the entity bean.
This interface allows the client to create, find, and remove entity
objects within the enterprise bean’s home as well as to execute home
business methods, which are not specific to a particular entity bean
object. A client can obtain the entity bean’s home interface through
dependency injection, or the client can look up the
entity bean’s home interface through JNDI.
It is the responsibility of the container to make the entity bean’s home
interface available in the JNDI name space.

A client view of an entity bean is
independent of the implementation of the entity bean and its container.
This ensures that a client application is portable across all container
implementations in which the entity bean might be deployed.


=== Remote Clients



A remote client
accesses an entity bean through the entity bean’s remote and remote home
interfaces. The remote and remote home interfaces of the entity bean
provide the remote client view.

The remote client view of an entity bean is
location independent. A client running in the same JVM as an entity bean
instance uses the same API to access the entity bean as a client running
in a different JVM on the same or different machine.

The container provides classes that implement
the entity bean’s remote and remote home interfaces. The objects that
implement the remote home and remote objects are remote Java objects,
and are accessible from a client through the standard Java™ APIs for
remote object invocation [link:Ejb.html#a3327[See Java Remote
Method Invocation (RMI).
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/.]].

A remote client of an entity object can be
another enterprise bean deployed in the same or different container or
can be an arbitrary Java program, such as an application, applet, or
servlet. The remote client view of an entity bean can also be mapped to
non-Java client environments, such as CORBA clients not written in the
Java programming language.

=== Local Clients



Entity beans may
also have local clients. A local client is a client that is collocated
with the entity bean and which may be tightly coupled to the bean.

Unlike the remote client view, the
local client view of an entity bean is not
location independent. The local client view requires the collocation in
the same JVM of both the local client and the entity bean that provides
the local client view. The local client view therefore does not provide
the location transparency provided by the remote client view.

A local client accesses an entity bean
through the entity bean’s local home and local component interfaces. The
container provides classes that implement the entity bean’s local home
and local component interfaces. The objects that implement the local
home and local component interfaces are local Java objects.

The arguments of the methods of the
local component interface and
local home interface are passed by
referencelink:#a3365[1]. Such entity beans and their clients
must be coded to assume that the state of any Java object that is passed
as an argument or result is potentially shared by caller and callee.

A local client of an entity bean may be a
session bean, a message-driven bean, another entity bean, or a web-tier
component.

The choice between the use of a local or
remote programming model is a design decision that the Bean Provider
makes when developing the entity bean application. In general, however,
entity beans are intended to be used with local clients. While it is
possible to provide both a client view and a local client view for an
entity bean with container-managed persistence, it is more likely that
the entity bean will be designed with the local view in mind.

Entity beans that have
container-managed relationships with other
entity beans, as described in link:Ejb.html#a384[See EJB 2.1
Entity Bean Component Contract for Container-Managed Persistence], must
be accessed in the same local scope as those related beans, and
therefore typically provide a local client view. In order to be the
target of a container-managed relationship, an entity bean with
container-managed persistence must provide a local component interface.

=== Choosing Between a Local or Remote Client View



The following considerations should be taken
into account in determining whether a local or
remote access should be used for an entity
bean:

When the EJB 2.1 and earlier remote home and
remote component interfaces are used, the narrowing of remote types
requires the use of javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow rather than
Java language casts.

Remote calls may involve error cases due to
communication, resource usage on other servers, etc., which are not
expected in local calls. When the EJB 2.1 and earlier remote home and
remote component interfaces are used, the client has to explicitly
program handlers for handling the _java.rmi.RemoteException_

Methods of a session bean’s remote business
interface must not expose entity beans local interface types, or the
managed collection classes that are used for EJB 2.1 entity beans with
container-managed persistence as arguments or results.

See EJB Core Contracts and Requirements
document link:Ejb.html#a3339[See EJB 3.2 Core Contracts and
Requirements. http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=345] Subsection “Choosing
Between a Local or Remote Client View” for the more considerations.



=== EJB Container



An EJB container (container for short) is a
system that functions as a runtime container for enterprise beans.

Multiple
enterprise beans can be deployed in a single container. For each entity
bean deployed in a container, the container provides a home interface
that allows the client to create, find, and remove entity objects that
belong to the entity bean. The home interface may also provide home
business methods, which are not specific to a particular entity bean
object. The container makes the entity bean’s home interface (defined by
the Bean Provider and implemented by the Container Provider) available
in the JNDI name space for clients.

An EJB server may host one or multiple EJB
containers. The containers are transparent to the client: there is no
client-level API to manipulate the container.

=== Locating an Entity Bean’s Home Interface

A client obtains
an entity bean’s home interface through dependency injection, or the
client locates an entity bean’s home interface using
JNDI. A client’s JNDI name space may be
configured to include the home interfaces of enterprise beans deployed
in multiple EJB containers located on multiple machines on a network.
The actual location of an EJB container is, in general, transparent to
the client.

For example, the local home interface for the
_Account_ entity bean can be located using the following code segment:

Context initialContext = new
InitialContext();

AccountHome accountHome = (AccountHome)


initialContext.lookup(“java:comp/env/ejb/accounts”);

If dependency injection were used, the home
interface could be obtained as follows:

@EJB AccountHome accountHome;

=== What a Container Provides

The following diagram illustrates the view
that a container provides to the client of the entity beans deployed in
the container. Note that a client may be a local client of some entity
beans and a remote client of others.

===

=== Entity Bean’s Remote Home Interface



This section is specific to entity beans that
provide a remote client view. Local home
interfaces are described in link:Ejb.html#a179[See Entity
Bean’s Local Home Interface].

The container provides the implementation of
the remote home interface for each entity bean deployed in the container
that defines a remote home interface. An object that implements an
entity bean’s remote home interface is called an _EJBHome object._

The entity bean’s
remote home interface allows a client to do the following:

Create new entity objects within the home.

Find existing entity objects within the home.

Remove an entity object from the home.

Execute a home business method.

Get the _javax.ejb.EJBMetaData_ interface for
the entity bean. The _javax.ejb.EJBMetaData_ interface is intended to
allow application assembly tools to discover the metadata information
about the entity bean. The metadata information allows loose
client/server binding and scripting.

Obtain a handle for the home interface. The
home handle can be serialized and written to
stable storage. Later, possibly in a different JVM, the
handle can be deserialized from stable
storage and used to obtain a reference to the home interface.

An entity bean’s remote home interface must
extend the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface and follow the standard rules for
Java programming language remote interfaces.

=== Create Methods

An entity bean’s remote home interface can
define zero or more create<METHOD> methods,
one for each way to create an entity object. The arguments of the create
methods are typically used to initialize the state of the created entity
object. The name of each create method starts with the prefix “ _create_
”.

The return type
of a create _<METHOD>_ method on the remote home interface is the entity
bean’s remote interface.

The _throws_ clause of every create
_<METHOD>_ method on the remote home interface includes the
java.rmi.RemoteException and the javax.ejb.CreateException. It may
include additional application-level exceptions.

The following home interface illustrates
three possible create methods:

public interface AccountHome extends
javax.ejb.EJBHome \{

 public Account create(String firstName,
String lastName,

 double initialBalance)

 throws RemoteException, CreateException;

 public Account create(String accountNumber,

 double initialBalance)

 throws RemoteException, CreateException,

 LowInitialBalanceException;

 public Account createLargeAccount(String
firstname,

 String lastname, double initialBalance)

 throws RemoteException, CreateException;

 ...

}



The following example illustrates how a
client creates a new entity object:

AccountHome accountHome = ...;

Account account = accountHome.create(“John”,
“Smith”, 500.00);



=== Finder Methods

An entity bean’s
remote home interface defines one or more finder
methodslink:#a3366[2], one for each way to find an entity object
or collection of entity objects within the home. The name of each finder
method starts with the prefix “ _find_ ”, such as _findLargeAccounts_ .
The arguments of a finder method are used by the entity bean
implementation to locate the requested entity objects. The return type
of a finder method on the remote home interface must be the entity
bean’s remote interface, or a type representing a collection of objects
that implement the entity bean’s remote interface (see Subsections
link:Ejb.html#a1446[See Finder Methods] and
link:Ejb.html#a2729[See Finder Method Return Type]).

The _throws_ clause of every finder method on
the remote home interface includes the java.rmi.RemoteException and the
javax.ejb.FinderException exceptions.

The remote home
interface includes the findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey) method, which allows
a client to locate an entity object using a primary key. The name of the
method is always findByPrimaryKey; it has a single argument that is the
same type as the entity bean’s primary key type, and its return type is
the entity bean’s remote interface. There is a unique
findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey) method for an entity bean on its remote
home interface; this method must not be overloaded. The implementation
of the findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey) method must ensure that the entity
object exists.

The following example shows the
findByPrimaryKey method:

public interface AccountHome extends
javax.ejb.EJBHome \{

 ...

 public Account findByPrimaryKey(String
AccountNumber)

 throws RemoteException, FinderException;

}

The following example illustrates how a
client uses the findByPrimaryKey method:

AccountHome = ...;

Account account =
accountHome.findByPrimaryKey(“100-3450-3333”);

=== Remove Methods

The
javax.ejb.EJBHome interface defines several methods that allow the
client to remove an entity object.

public interface EJBHome extends Remote \{

 void remove(Handle handle) throws
RemoteException,

 RemoveException;

 void remove(Object primaryKey) throws
RemoteException,

 RemoveException;

}

After an entity object has been removed,
subsequent attempts to access the entity object by a remote client
result in the java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException.

=== Home Methods

An entity bean’s
remote home interface may define one or more
home methods. Home methods are methods that
the Bean Provider supplies for business logic that is not specific to an
entity bean instance.

Home methods on the remote home interface can
have arbitrary method names, but they must not start with “ _create_ ”,
“ _find_ ”, or “ _remove_ ”.The arguments of a home method are used by
the entity bean implementation in computations that do not depend on a
specific entity bean instance. The method arguments and return value
types of a home method on the remote home interface must be legal types
for RMI-IIOP.

The _throws_ clause of every home method on
the remote home interface includes the java.rmi.RemoteException. It may
also include additional application-level exceptions.

The following example shows two home methods:

public interface EmployeeHome extends
javax.ejb.EJBHome \{

 ...

 // this method returns a living index
depending on

 // the state and the base salary of an
employee:

 // the method is not specific to an instance

 public float livingIndex(String state, float
Salary)

 throws RemoteException;



 // this method adds a bonus to all of the
employees

 // based on a company profit-sharing index

 public void addBonus(float
company_share_index)

 throws RemoteException,
ShareIndexOutOfRangeException;



 ...

}

=== [[a179]]Entity Bean’s Local Home Interface



The container provides the implementation of
the local home interface for each entity bean deployed in the container
that defines a local home interface. An object that implements an entity
bean’s local home interface is called an _EJBLocalHome object._

The entity bean’s
local home interface allows a local client to do the following:

Create new entity objects within the home.

Find existing entity objects within the home.

Remove an entity object from the home.

Execute a home business method.

An entity bean’s local home interface must
extend the javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome interface.

=== Create Methods

An entity bean’s local home interface can
define zero or more create<METHOD> methods, one for each way to create
an entity object. The arguments of the create methods are typically used
to initialize the state of the created entity object. The name of each
create method starts with the prefix “ _create_ ”.

The return type
of a create _<METHOD>_ method on the local home interface is the entity
bean’s local interface.

The _throws_ clause of every create
_<METHOD>_ method on the local home interface includes the
javax.ejb.CreateException. It may include additional application-level
exceptions. It must not include the java.rmi.RemoteException.

The following local home interface
illustrates three possible create methods:

public interface AccountHome extends
javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome \{

 public Account create(String firstName,
String lastName,

 double initialBalance)

 throws CreateException;

 public Account create(String accountNumber,

 double initialBalance)

 throws CreateException,
LowInitialBalanceException;

 public Account createLargeAccount(String
firstname,

 String lastname, double initialBalance)

 throws CreateException;

 ...

}

The following example illustrates how a
client creates a new entity object:

AccountHome accountHome = ...;

Account account = accountHome.create(“John”,
“Smith”, 500.00);

=== Finder Methods

An entity bean’s
local home interface defines one or more finder
methodslink:#a3367[3], one for each way to find an entity object
or collection of entity objects within the home. The name of each finder
method starts with the prefix “ _find_ ”, such as _findLargeAccounts_ .
The arguments of a finder method are used by the entity bean
implementation to locate the requested entity objects. The return type
of a finder method on the local home interface must be the entity bean’s
local interface, or a type representing a collection of objects that
implement the entity bean’s local interface (see Subsections
link:Ejb.html#a1446[See Finder Methods] and
link:Ejb.html#a2729[See Finder Method Return Type]).

The _throws_ clause of every finder method on
the local home interface includes the javax.ejb.FinderException. The
_throws_ clause must not include the java.rmi.RemoteException.

The local home
interface includes the findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey) method, which allows
a client to locate an entity object using a primary key. The name of the
method is always findByPrimaryKey; it has a single argument that is the
same type as the entity bean’s primary key type, and its return type is
the entity bean’s local interface. There is a unique
findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey) method for an entity bean on its local home
interface; this method must not be overloaded. The implementation of the
findByPrimaryKey method must ensure that the entity object exists.

The following example shows the
findByPrimaryKey method:

public interface AccountHome extends
javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome \{

 ...

 public Account findByPrimaryKey(String
AccountNumber)

 throws FinderException;

}

The following example illustrates how a
client uses the findByPrimaryKey method:

AccountHome = ...;

Account account =
accountHome.findByPrimaryKey(“100-3450-3333”);

=== Remove Methods

The
javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome interface defines the _remove_ method to allow
the client to remove an entity object.

public interface EJBLocalHome \{

 void remove(Object primaryKey) throws
RemoveException,

 EJBException;

}

After an entity object has been removed,
subsequent attempts to access the local entity object by the local
client result in the javax.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException.

=== Home Methods

An entity bean’s
local home interface may define one or more
home methods. Home methods are methods that
the Bean Provider supplies for business logic that is not specific to an
entity bean instance.

Home methods can have arbitrary method names,
but they must not start with “ _create_ ”, “ _find_ ”, or “ _remove_
”.The arguments of a home method are used by the entity bean
implementation in computations that do not depend on a specific entity
bean instance.

The _throws_ clause of a home method on the
local home interface may include additional application-level
exceptions. It must not include the java.rmi.RemoteException.

The following example shows two home methods:

public interface EmployeeHome extends
javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome \{

 ...

 // this method returns a living index
depending on

 // the state and the base salary of an
employee:

 // the method is not specific to an instance

 public float livingIndex(String state, float
Salary);



 // this method adds a bonus to all of the
employees

 // based on a company profit sharing index

 public void addBonus(float
company_share_index)

 throws ShareIndexOutOfRangeException;



 ...

}

=== Entity Object’s Life Cycle



This section describes the life cycle of an
entity object from the perspective of a client.

The following
diagram illustrates a client’s point of view of an entity object life
cycle. (The term “referenced” in the diagram means that the client
program has a reference to the entity object’s remote or local
interface.)

===



Client View of Entity Object Life Cycle

image:EBOpt-7.png[image]

An entity object does not exist until it is
created. Until it is created, it has no identity. After it is created,
it has identity. A client creates an entity object using the entity
bean’s home interface, whose class is implemented by the container. When
a client creates an entity object, the client obtains a reference to the
newly created entity object.

In an environment with
legacy data, entity objects may “exist”
before the container and entity bean are deployed. In addition, an
entity object may be “created” in the environment via a mechanism other
than by invoking a create<METHOD> method of the home interface (e.g. by
inserting a database record), but still may be accessible via the finder
methods. Also, an entity object may be deleted directly using other
means than the remove operation (e.g. by deletion of a database record).
The “direct insert” and “direct delete” transitions in the diagram
represent such direct database manipulation.

All entity objects are considered
persistent objects. The lifetime of an
entity object is not limited by the lifetime of the Java Virtual Machine
process in which the entity bean instance executes. While a crash of the
Java Virtual Machine may result in a rollback of current transactions,
it does not destroy previously created entity objects nor invalidate the
references to the home and component interfaces held by clients.

Multiple clients
can access the same entity object concurrently. Transactions are used to
isolate the clients’ work from each other.

=== References to Entity Object Remote Interfaces

A client can get a reference to an existing
entity object’s remote interface in any of
the following ways:

Receive the reference as a parameter in a
method call (input parameter or result).

Find the entity object using a finder method
defined in the entity bean’s remote home interface.

Obtain the reference from the entity object’s
handle. (See Section link:Ejb.html#a349[See Entity Bean’s
Handle]).

A client that has a reference to an entity
object’s remote interface can do any of the following:

Invoke business methods on the entity object
through the remote interface.

Obtain a reference to the enterprise bean’s
remote home interface.

Pass the reference as a parameter or return
value of a method call.

Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

Obtain the entity object’s handle.

Remove the entity object.

All references to an entity object that does
not exist are invalid. All attempted invocations on an entity object
that does not exist result in an java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException being
thrown.

=== References to Entity Object Local Interfaces

A local client can get a reference to an
existing entity object’s local interface in
any of the following ways:

Receive the reference as a result of a method
call.

Find the entity object using a finder method
defined in the entity bean’s local home interface.

A local client that has a reference to an
entity object’s local interface can do any of the following:

Invoke business methods on the entity object
through the local interface.

Obtain a reference to the enterprise bean’s
local home interface.

Pass the reference as a parameter or return
value of a local method call.

Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

Remove the entity object.

All local references to an entity object that
does not exist are invalid. All attempted invocations on an entity
object that does not exist result in a
javax.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException being thrown.

A local interface type must not be passed as
an argument or result of a remote interface method.

=== References to Entity Object and Stateful Session Bean Instance Passivation and Conversational State

If an entity bean is
referenced from a stateful session bean, the
Bean Provider is required to ensure that the _PrePassivate_ method
leaves the instance fields ready to be serialized by the container. In
addition to the rules described in EJB Core Contracts and Requirements
document link:Ejb.html#a3339[See EJB 3.2 Core Contracts and
Requirements. http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=345] Subsection “Instance
Passivation and Conversational State”, for the entity bean references,
the objects that are assigned to the instance’s non- _transient_ fields
after the session bean _PrePassivate_ method completes can also be one
of the following:

A reference to an entity bean’s local
component interface, even if it is not serializable.

A reference to an entity bean’s local home
interface, even if it is not serializable.



=== Primary Key and Object Identity



Every entity
object has a unique identity within its home. If two entity objects have
the same home and the same primary key, they are considered identical.

The Enterprise
JavaBeans architecture allows a primary key class to be any class that
is a legal Value Type in RMI-IIOP, subject to the restrictions defined
in Subsections link:Ejb.html#a1725[See Entity Bean’s Primary Key
Class] and link:Ejb.html#a3011[See Entity Bean’s Primary Key
Class]. The primary key class may be specific to an entity bean class
(i.e., each entity bean class may define a different class for its
primary key, but it is possible that multiple entity beans use the same
primary key class).

A client that
holds a reference to an entity object’s component interface can
determine the entity object’s identity within its home by invoking the
getPrimaryKey method on the reference.

The object
identity associated with a reference does not change over the lifetime
of the reference. (That is, getPrimaryKey always returns the same value
when called on the same entity object reference). If an entity object
has both a remote home interface and a local home interface, the result
of invoking the getPrimaryKey method on a reference to the entity
object’s remote interface and on a reference to the entity object’s
local interface is the same.

A client can test whether two entity object
references refer to the same entity object by using the _isIdentical_
 method. Alternatively, if a client obtains
two entity object references from the same home, it can determine if
they refer to the same entity by comparing their primary keys using the
equals method.

The following code illustrates using the
isIdentical method to test if two object references refer to the same
entity object:

Account acc1 = ...;

Account acc2 = ...;



if (acc1.isIdentical(acc2)) \{

 // acc1 and acc2 are the same entity object

} else \{

 // acc2 and acc2 are different entity
objects

}

A client that knows the primary key of an
entity object can obtain a reference to the entity object by invoking
the findByPrimaryKey(key) method on the entity bean’s home interface.

Note that the Enterprise JavaBeans
architecture does not specify “object equality” (i.e. use of the ==
operator) for entity object references. The result of comparing two
object references using the Java programming language
Object.equals(Object obj) method is unspecified. Performing the
Object.hashCode() method on two object references that represent the
entity object is not guaranteed to yield the same result. Therefore, a
client should always use the isIdentical method to determine if two
entity object references refer to the same entity object.

Note that the use of _isIdentical_ for the
comparison of object references applies to the implementation of the
methods of the _java.util.Collection_ API as well.

=== Entity Bean’s Remote Interface



A client can
access an entity object through the entity bean’s remote interface. An
entity bean’s remote interface must extend the javax.ejb.EJBObject
interface. A remote interface defines the business methods that are
callable by remote clients.

The following example illustrates the
definition of an entity bean’s remote interface:

public interface Account extends
javax.ejb.EJBObject \{

 void debit(double amount)

 throws java.rmi.RemoteException,

 InsufficientBalanceException;

 void credit(double amount)

 throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

 double getBalance()

 throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

}

The javax.ejb.EJBObject interface defines the
methods that allow the client to perform the following operations on an
entity object’s reference:

Obtain the remote home interface for the
entity object.

Remove the entity object.

Obtain the entity object’s handle.

Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

The container provides the implementation of
the methods defined in the javax.ejb.EJBObject interface. Only the
business methods are delegated to the instances of the enterprise bean
class.

Note that the entity object does not expose
the methods of the javax.ejb.EnterpriseBean interface to the client.
These methods are not intended for the client—they are used by the
container to manage the enterprise bean instances.

=== Entity Bean’s Local Interface



A local client
can access an entity object through the entity bean’s local interface.
An entity bean’s local interface must extend the
javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject interface. A local interface defines the
business methods that are callable by local clients.

The following example illustrates the
definition of an entity bean’s local interface:

public interface Account extends
javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject \{

 void debit(double amount)

 throws InsufficientBalanceException;

 void credit(double amount);

 double getBalance();

}

 _Note that the methods of the entity bean’s
local interface must not throw the java.rmi.RemoteException._

The
javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject interface defines
the methods that allow the local client to
perform the following operations on an
entity object’s local reference:

Obtain the local home interface for the
entity object.

Remove the entity object.

Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

The container provides the implementation of
the methods defined in the javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject interface. Only the
business methods are delegated to the instances of the enterprise bean
class.

Note that the entity object does not expose
the methods of the javax.ejb.EntityBean or the optional
_javax.ejb.TimedObject_ interface to the local client. These methods are
not intended for the local client—they are used by the container to
manage the enterprise bean instances.

=== [[a349]]Entity Bean’s Handle



An entity
object’s handle is an object that identifies the entity object on a
network. A client that has a reference to an entity object’s remote
interface can obtain the entity object’s handle by invoking the
getHandle method on the remote interface. The _getHandle_ method is only
available on the remote interface.

Since a handle
class extends java.io.Serializable, a client may serialize the handle.
The client may use the serialized handle later, possibly in a different
process or even system, to re-obtain a reference to the entity object
identified by the handle.

The client code must use the
javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow method to convert the result of
the getEJBObject method invoked on a handle to the entity bean’s remote
interface type.

The lifetime and scope of a handle is
specific to the handle implementation. At the minimum, a program running
in one JVM must be able to obtain and serialize the handle, and another
program running in a different JVM must be able to deserialize it and
re-create an object reference. An entity handle is typically implemented
to be usable over a long period of time—it must be usable at least
across a server restart.

Containers that store long-lived entities
will typically provide handle implementations that allow clients to
store a handle for a long time (possibly many years). Such a handle will
be usable even if parts of the technology used by the container (e.g.
ORB, DBMS, server) have been upgraded or replaced while the client has
stored the handle. Support for this “quality of service” is not required
by the EJB specification.

An EJB container is not required to accept a
handle that was generated by another vendor’s EJB container.

The use of a handle is illustrated by the
following example:

// A client obtains a handle of an account
entity object and

// stores the handle in stable storage.

//

ObjectOutputStream stream = ...;

Account account = ...;

Handle handle = account.getHandle();

stream.writeObject(handle);



// A client can read the handle from stable
storage, and use the

// handle to resurrect an object reference to
the

// account entity object.

//

ObjectInputStream stream = ...;

Handle handle = (Handle)
stream.readObject(handle);

Account account =
(Account)javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow(

 handle.getEJBObject(), Account.class);

account.debit(100.00);

A handle is not a capability, in the security
sense, that would automatically grant its holder the right to invoke
methods on the object. When a reference to an object is obtained from a
handle, and then a method on the object is invoked, the container
performs the usual access checks based on the caller’s principal.

=== Entity Home Handles



The EJB
specification allows a client to obtain a handle for the remote home
interface. The client can use the home handle to store a reference to an
entity bean’s remote home interface in stable storage, and re-create the
reference later. This handle functionality may be useful to a client
that needs to use the remote home interface in the future, but does not
know the JNDI name of the remote home interface.

A handle to a remote home interface must
implement the javax.ejb.HomeHandle interface.

The client code must use the
javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow method to convert the result of
the getEJBHome method invoked on a handle to the home interface type.

The lifetime and scope of a handle is
specific to the handle implementation. At a minimum, a program running
in one JVM must be able to serialize the handle, and another program
running in a different JVM must be able to deserialize it and re-create
an object reference. An entity handle is typically implemented to be
usable over a long period of time—it must be usable at least across a
server restart.

=== Type Narrowing of Object References



A client program
that is intended to be interoperable with all compliant EJB container
implementations must use the javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow
method to perform type-narrowing of the client-side representations of
the remote home and remote interfaces.

Note: Programs that use the
cast operator to narrow the remote and
remote home interfaces are likely to fail if the container
implementation uses RMI-IIOP as the underlying communication transport.
