== Client View of an Entity Bean

This chapter describes the client view of an entity bean. It is actually a contract fulfilled by the container in which the entity bean is deployed.
Only the business methods are supplied by the enterprise bean itself.

Although the client view of the deployed entity beans is provided by classes implemented by the container, the container itself is transparent to the client.

=== Overview

For a client, an entity bean is a component that represents an object-oriented view of some entities stored in a persistent storage, such as a database, or entities that are implemented by an existing enterprise application.

The client of an entity bean may be a local client or the client may be a remote client.

This section provides an overview of the entity bean client view that is independent of whether the client is a remote client or a local client.
The differences between remote clients and local clients are discussed in the following sections.

From its creation until its destruction, an entity object lives in a container.
Transparently to the client, the container provides security, concurrency, transactions, persistence, and other services for the entity objects that live in the container.
The container is transparent to the client—there is no API that a client can use to manipulate the container.

Multiple clients can access an entity object concurrently. The container in which the entity bean is deployed properly synchronizes access to the entity object’s state using transactions.

Each entity object has an identity which, in general, survives a crash and restart of the container in which the entity object has been created.
The object identity is implemented by the container with the cooperation of the enterprise bean class.

Multiple enterprise beans can be deployed in a container.
For each entity bean deployed in a container, the container provides a class that implements a home interface for the entity bean.
This interface allows the client to create, find, and remove entity objects within the enterprise bean’s home as well as to execute home business methods, which are not specific to a particular entity bean object.
A client can obtain the entity bean’s home interface through dependency injection, or the client can look up the entity bean’s home interface through JNDI.
It is the responsibility of the container to make the entity bean’s home interface available in the JNDI name space.

A client view of an entity bean is independent of the implementation of the entity bean and its container.
This ensures that a client application is portable across all container implementations in which the entity bean might be deployed.

=== Remote Clients

A remote client accesses an entity bean through the entity bean’s remote and remote home interfaces.
The remote and remote home interfaces of the entity bean provide the remote client view.

The remote client view of an entity bean is location independent.
A client running in the same JVM as an entity bean instance uses the same API to access the entity bean as a client running in a different JVM on the same or different machine.

The container provides classes that implement the entity bean’s remote and remote home interfaces.
The objects that implement the remote home and remote objects are remote Java objects, and are accessible from a client through the standard Java™ APIs for remote object invocation <<a3327>>.

A remote client of an entity object can be another enterprise bean deployed in the same or different container or can be an arbitrary Java program, such as an application, applet, or servlet.
The remote client view of an entity bean can also be mapped to non-Java client environments, such as CORBA clients not written in the Java programming language.

=== Local Clients

Entity beans may also have local clients.
A local client is a client that is collocated with the entity bean and which may be tightly coupled to the bean.

Unlike the remote client view, the local client view of an entity bean is not location independent.
The local client view requires the collocation in the same JVM of both the local client and the entity bean that provides the local client view. The local client view therefore does not provide the location transparency provided by the remote client view.

A local client accesses an entity bean through the entity bean’s local home and local component interfaces.
The container provides classes that implement the entity bean’s local home and local component interfaces. The objects that implement the local home and local component interfaces are local Java objects.

The arguments of the methods of the local component interface and local home interface are passed by reference.
footnote:a3365[More literally, references are passed by value in the JVM: an argument variable of primitive type holds a value of that primitive type; an argument variable of a reference type hold a reference to the object. See <<a3334>>.]
Such entity beans and their clients must be coded to assume that the state of any Java object that is passed as an argument or result is potentially shared by caller and callee.

A local client of an entity bean may be a session bean, a message-driven bean, another entity bean, or a web-tier component.

The choice between the use of a local or remote programming model is a design decision that the Bean Provider
makes when developing the entity bean application.
In general, however, entity beans are intended to be used with local clients.
While it is possible to provide both a client view and a local client view for an entity bean with container-managed persistence, it is more likely that the entity bean will be designed with the local view in mind.

Entity beans that have container-managed relationships with other entity beans, as described in <<a384>>, must be accessed in the same local scope as those related beans, and therefore typically provide a local client view.
In order to be the target of a container-managed relationship, an entity bean with container-managed persistence must provide a local component interface.

=== Choosing Between a Local or Remote Client View

The following considerations should be taken into account in determining whether a local or remote access should be used for an entity bean:

* When the Enterprise Beans 2.1 and earlier remote home and remote component interfaces are used, the narrowing of remote types requires the use of `javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow` rather than Java language casts.

* Remote calls may involve error cases due to communication, resource usage on other servers, etc., which are not expected in local calls. 
When the Enterprise Beans 2.1 and earlier remote home and remote component interfaces are used, the client has to explicitly program handlers for handling the `java.rmi.RemoteException`

* Methods of a session bean’s remote business interface must not expose entity beans local interface types, or the managed collection classes that are used for Enterprise Beans 2.1 entity beans with container-managed persistence as arguments or results.

See Enterprise Beans Core Contracts and Requirements
document <<a3339>> Subsection "Choosing Between a Local or Remote Client View" for the more considerations.

=== Enterprise Beans Container

An Enterprise Beans container (container for short) is a system that functions as a runtime container for enterprise beans.

Multiple enterprise beans can be deployed in a single container.
For each entity bean deployed in a container, the container provides a home interface that allows the client to create, find, and remove entity objects that belong to the entity bean.
The home interface may also provide home business methods, which are not specific to a particular entity bean object.
The container makes the entity bean’s home interface (defined by the Bean Provider and implemented by the Container Provider) available in the JNDI name space for clients.

An Enterprise Beans server may host one or multiple Enterprise Beans containers.
The containers are transparent to the client: there is no client-level API to manipulate the container.

==== Locating an Entity Bean’s Home Interface

A client obtains an entity bean’s home interface through dependency injection, or the client locates an entity bean’s home interface using JNDI.
A client’s JNDI name space may be configured to include the home interfaces of enterprise beans deployed in multiple Enterprise Beans containers located on multiple machines on a network.
The actual location of an Enterprise Beans container is, in general, transparent to the client.

For example, the local home interface for the
`Account` entity bean can be located using the following code segment:
[source, java]
----
Context initialContext = new InitialContext();
AccountHome accountHome = (AccountHome)
              initialContext.lookup("java:comp/env/ejb/accounts");
----

If dependency injection were used, the home interface could be obtained as follows:
[source, java]
----
@EJB 
AccountHome accountHome;
----

==== What a Container Provides

The following diagram illustrates the view that a container provides to the client of the entity beans deployed in the container.
Note that a client may be a local client of some entity beans and a remote client of others.

=== Entity Bean’s Remote Home Interface

This section is specific to entity beans that provide a remote client view.
Local home interfaces are described in <<a179>>.

The container provides the implementation of the remote home interface for each entity bean deployed in the container that defines a remote home interface.
An object that implements an entity bean’s remote home interface is called an *EJBHome* object.

The entity bean’s remote home interface allows a client to do the following:

* Create new entity objects within the home.

* Find existing entity objects within the home.

* Remove an entity object from the home.

* Execute a home business method.

* Get the `jakarta.ejb.EJBMetaData` interface for the entity bean.
The `jakarta.ejb.EJBMetaData` interface is intended to allow application assembly tools to discover the metadata information about the entity bean.
The metadata information allows loose client/server binding and scripting.

* Obtain a handle for the home interface.
The home handle can be serialized and written to stable storage.
Later, possibly in a different JVM, the handle can be deserialized from stable storage and used to obtain a reference to the home interface.

An entity bean’s remote home interface must extend the `jakarta.ejb.EJBHome` interface and follow the standard rules for Java programming language remote interfaces.

==== Create Methods

An entity bean’s remote home interface can define zero or more `create<METHOD>` methods, one for each way to create an entity object.
The arguments of the `create` methods are typically used to initialize the state of the created entity object.
The name of each `create` method starts with the prefix "```create```".

The return type of a `create<METHOD>` method on the remote home interface is the entity bean’s remote interface.

The `throws` clause of every `create<METHOD>` method on the remote home interface includes the `java.rmi.RemoteException` and the `jakarta.ejb.CreateException`.
It may include additional application-level exceptions.

The following home interface illustrates three possible create methods:
[source, java]
----
public interface AccountHome extends jakarta.ejb.EJBHome {
    public Account create(String firstName, String lastName,
        double initialBalance)
         throws RemoteException, CreateException;
    public Account create(String accountNumber, 
        double initialBalance)
         throws RemoteException, CreateException,
             LowInitialBalanceException;
    public Account createLargeAccount(String firstname, 
        String lastname, double initialBalance)
         throws RemoteException, CreateException;
     ...
}
----

The following example illustrates how a client creates a new entity object:
[source, java]
----
AccountHome accountHome = ...;
Account account = accountHome.create("John", "Smith", 500.00);
----

==== Finder Methods

An entity bean’s remote home interface defines one or more finder methods
footnote:a3366[The `findByPrimaryKey` method is mandatory for the remote home interface of all entity beans.]
, one for each way to find an entity object or collection of entity objects within the home.
The name of each finder method starts with the prefix "```find```", such as `findLargeAccounts`.
The arguments of a finder method are used by the entity bean implementation to locate the requested entity objects.
The return type of a finder method on the remote home interface must be the entity bean’s remote interface, or a type representing a collection of objects that implement the entity bean’s remote interface (see <<a1446>> and <<a2729>>).

The `throws` clause of every finder method on the remote home interface includes the `java.rmi.RemoteException` and the `jakarta.ejb.FinderException` exceptions.

The remote home interface includes the `findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey)` method, which allows a client to locate an entity object using a primary key.
The name of the method is always `findByPrimaryKey`; it has a single argument that is the same type as the entity bean’s primary key type, and its return type is the entity bean’s remote interface.
There is a unique `findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey)` method for an entity bean on its remote home interface; this method must not be overloaded.
The implementation of the `findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey)` method must ensure that the entity object exists.

The following example shows the `findByPrimaryKey` method:
[source, java]
----
public interface AccountHome extends jakarta.ejb.EJBHome {
     ...
    public Account findByPrimaryKey(String AccountNumber)
        throws RemoteException, FinderException;
}
----

The following example illustrates how a client uses the `findByPrimaryKey` method:
[source, java]
----
AccountHome = ...;
Account account = accountHome.findByPrimaryKey("100-3450-3333");
----

==== Remove Methods

The `jakarta.ejb.EJBHome` interface defines several methods that allow the client to remove an entity object.
[source, java]
----
public interface EJBHome extends Remote {
    void remove(Handle handle) throws RemoteException,
        RemoveException;
    void remove(Object primaryKey) throws RemoteException,
        RemoveException;
}
----

After an entity object has been removed, subsequent attempts to access the entity object by a remote client result in the `java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException`.

==== Home Methods

An entity bean’s remote home interface may define one or more
home methods.
Home methods are methods that the Bean Provider supplies for business logic that is not specific to an entity bean instance.

Home methods on the remote home interface can have arbitrary method names, but they must not start with "```create```", "```find```", or "```remove```".
The arguments of a home method are used by the entity bean implementation in computations that do not depend on a specific entity bean instance.
The method arguments and return value types of a home method on the remote home interface must be legal types for RMI-IIOP.

The `throws` clause of every home method on the remote home interface includes the `java.rmi.RemoteException`.
It may also include additional application-level exceptions.

The following example shows two home methods:
[source, java]
----
public interface EmployeeHome extends jakarta.ejb.EJBHome {
    ...
    // this method returns a living index depending on
    // the state and the base salary of an employee:
    // the method is not specific to an instance
    public float livingIndex(String state, float salary)
        throws RemoteException;

    // this method adds a bonus to all of the employees
    // based on a company profit-sharing index
    public void addBonus(float company_share_index)
        throws RemoteException, ShareIndexOutOfRangeException;
    ...
}
----

[[a179]]
=== Entity Bean’s Local Home Interface

The container provides the implementation of the local home interface for each entity bean deployed in the container that defines a local home interface.
An object that implements an entity bean’s local home interface is called an *EJBLocalHome* object.

The entity bean’s local home interface allows a local client to do the following:

* Create new entity objects within the home.

* Find existing entity objects within the home.

* Remove an entity object from the home.

* Execute a home business method.

An entity bean’s local home interface must extend the `jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalHome` interface.

==== Create Methods

An entity bean’s local home interface can define zero or more `create<METHOD>` methods, one for each way to create an entity object.
The arguments of the `create` methods are typically used to initialize the state of the created entity object.
The name of each create method starts with the prefix "```create```".

The return type of a `create<METHOD>` method on the local home interface is the entity bean’s local interface.

The `throws` clause of every `create<METHOD>` method on the local home interface includes the `jakarta.ejb.CreateException`.
It may include additional application-level exceptions.
It must not include the `java.rmi.RemoteException`.

The following local home interface illustrates three possible create methods:
[source, java]
----
public interface AccountHome extends jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalHome {
    public Account create(String firstName, String lastName,
        double initialBalance)
         throws CreateException;
    public Account create(String accountNumber,
        double initialBalance)
         throws CreateException, LowInitialBalanceException;
    public Account createLargeAccount(String firstname,
        String lastname, double initialBalance)
         throws CreateException;
    ...
}
----

The following example illustrates how a client creates a new entity object:
[source, java]
----
AccountHome accountHome = ...;
Account account = accountHome.create("John", "Smith", 500.00);
----

==== Finder Methods

An entity bean’s local home interface defines one or more finder methods
footnote:a3367[The `findByPrimaryKey` method is mandatory for the local home interface of all Entity Beans.]
, one for each way to find an entity object or collection of entity objects within the home.
The name of each finder method starts with the prefix "```find```", such as `findLargeAccounts`.
The arguments of a finder method are used by the entity bean
implementation to locate the requested entity objects.
The return type of a finder method on the local home interface must be the entity bean’s local interface, or a type representing a collection of objects that implement the entity bean’s local interface (see <<a1446>> and <<a2729>>).

The `throws` clause of every finder method on the local home interface includes the `jakarta.ejb.FinderException`.
The `throws` clause must not include the `java.rmi.RemoteException`.

The local home interface includes the `findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey)` method, which allows a client to locate an entity object using a primary key.
The name of the method is always `findByPrimaryKey`; it has a single argument that is the same type as the entity bean’s primary key type, and its return type is the entity bean’s local interface.
There is a unique `findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey)` method for an entity bean on its local home interface; this method must not be overloaded.
The implementation of the `findByPrimaryKey` method must ensure that the entity object exists.

The following example shows the `findByPrimaryKey` method:
[source, java]
----
public interface AccountHome extends jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalHome {
    ...
    public Account findByPrimaryKey(String AccountNumber)
        throws FinderException;
}
----

The following example illustrates how a client uses the `findByPrimaryKey` method:
[source, java]
----
AccountHome accountHome = ...;
Account account = accountHome.findByPrimaryKey("100-3450-3333");
----

==== Remove Methods

The `jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalHome` interface defines the `remove` method to allow the client to remove an entity object.
[source, java]
----
public interface EJBLocalHome {
    void remove(Object primaryKey) throws RemoveException,
        EJBException;
}
----

After an entity object has been removed, subsequent attempts to access the local entity object by the local client result in the `jakarta.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException`.

==== Home Methods

An entity bean’s local home interface may define one or more home methods.
Home methods are methods that the Bean Provider supplies for business logic that is not specific to an entity bean instance.

Home methods can have arbitrary method names, but they must not start with "```create```", "```find```" or "```remove```".
The arguments of a home method are used by the entity bean implementation in computations that do not depend on a specific entity bean instance.

The `throws` clause of a home method on the local home interface may include additional application-level exceptions.
It must not include the `java.rmi.RemoteException`.

The following example shows two home methods:
[source, java]
----
public interface EmployeeHome extends jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalHome {
    ...
    // this method returns a living index depending on
    // the state and the base salary of an employee:
    // the method is not specific to an instance
    public float livingIndex(String state, float salary);

    // this method adds a bonus to all of the employees
    // based on a company profit sharing index
    public void addBonus(float company_share_index) 
        throws ShareIndexOutOfRangeException;
    ...
}
----

=== Entity Object’s Life Cycle

This section describes the life cycle of an entity object from the perspective of a client.

The following diagram illustrates a client’s point of view of an entity object life cycle. 
(The term "referenced" in the diagram means that the client program has a reference to the entity object’s remote or local interface.)

.Client View of Entity Object Life Cycle
image::EBOpt-7.png[]

An entity object does not exist until it is created.
Until it is created, it has no identity.
After it is created, it has identity.
A client creates an entity object using the entity bean’s home interface, whose class is implemented by the container.
When a client creates an entity object, the client obtains a reference to the newly created entity object.

In an environment with legacy data, entity objects may "`exist`" before the container and entity bean are deployed.
In addition, an entity object may be "`created`" in the environment via a mechanism other than by invoking a `create<METHOD>` method of the home interface (e.g. by inserting a database record), but still may be accessible via the finder methods.
Also, an entity object may be deleted directly using other means than the remove operation (e.g. by deletion of a database record).
The "`direct insert`" and "`direct delete`" transitions in the diagram represent such direct database manipulation.

All entity objects are considered persistent objects.
The lifetime of an entity object is not limited by the lifetime of the Java Virtual Machine process in which the entity bean instance executes.
While a crash of the Java Virtual Machine may result in a rollback of current transactions, it does not destroy previously created entity objects nor invalidate the references to the home and component interfaces held by clients.

Multiple clients can access the same entity object concurrently.
Transactions are used to isolate the clients’ work from each other.

==== References to Entity Object Remote Interfaces

A client can get a reference to an existing entity object’s remote interface in any of the following ways:

* Receive the reference as a parameter in a method call (input parameter or result).

* Find the entity object using a finder method defined in the entity bean’s remote home interface.

* Obtain the reference from the entity object’s handle. (See <<a349>>).

A client that has a reference to an entity object’s remote interface can do any of the following:

* Invoke business methods on the entity object through the remote interface.

* Obtain a reference to the enterprise bean’s remote home interface.

* Pass the reference as a parameter or return value of a method call.

* Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

* Obtain the entity object’s handle.

* Remove the entity object.

All references to an entity object that does not exist are invalid.
All attempted invocations on an entity object that does not exist result in an `java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException` being thrown.

==== References to Entity Object Local Interfaces

A local client can get a reference to an existing entity object’s local interface in any of the following ways:

* Receive the reference as a result of a method call.

* Find the entity object using a finder method defined in the entity bean’s local home interface.

A local client that has a reference to an entity object’s local interface can do any of the following:

* Invoke business methods on the entity object through the local interface.

* Obtain a reference to the enterprise bean’s local home interface.

* Pass the reference as a parameter or return value of a local method call.

* Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

* Remove the entity object.

All local references to an entity object that does not exist are invalid.
All attempted invocations on an entity object that does not exist result in a `jakarta.ejb.NoSuchObjectLocalException` being thrown.

A local interface type must not be passed as an argument or result of a remote interface method.

==== References to Entity Object and Stateful Session Bean Instance Passivation and Conversational State

If an entity bean is referenced from a stateful session bean, the Bean Provider is required to ensure that the `PrePassivate` method leaves the instance fields ready to be serialized by the container.
In addition to the rules described in Enterprise Beans Core Contracts and Requirements document <<a3339>> Subsection "Instance Passivation and Conversational State", for the entity bean references, the objects that are assigned to the instance’s non-`transient` fields after the session bean `PrePassivate` method completes can also be one of the following:

* A reference to an entity bean’s local component interface, even if it is not serializable.

* A reference to an entity bean’s local home interface, even if it is not serializable.

=== Primary Key and Object Identity

Every entity object has a unique identity within its home.
If two entity objects have the same home and the same primary key, they are considered identical.

The Enterprise Beans architecture allows a primary key class to be any class that is a legal Value Type in RMI-IIOP, subject to the restrictions defined in <<a1725>> and <<a3011>>.
The primary key class may be specific to an entity bean class (i.e., each entity bean class may define a different class for its primary key, but it is possible that multiple entity beans use the same primary key class).

A client that holds a reference to an entity object’s component interface can determine the entity object’s identity within its home by invoking the `getPrimaryKey` method on the reference.

The object identity associated with a reference does not change over the lifetime of the reference.
(That is, `getPrimaryKey` always returns the same value when called on the same entity object reference).
If an entity object has both a remote home interface and a local home interface, the result of invoking the `getPrimaryKey` method on a reference to the entity object’s remote interface and on a reference to the entity object’s local interface is the same.

A client can test whether two entity object references refer to the same entity object by using the `isIdentical` method.
Alternatively, if a client obtains two entity object references from the same home, it can determine if they refer to the same entity by comparing their primary keys using the `equals` method.

The following code illustrates using the `isIdentical` method to test if two object references refer to the same entity object:
[source, java]
----
Account acc1 = ...;
Account acc2 = ...;

if (acc1.isIdentical(acc2)) {
    // acc1 and acc2 are the same entity object
} else {
    // acc2 and acc2 are different entity objects
}
----

A client that knows the primary key of an entity object can obtain a reference to the entity object by invoking the `findByPrimaryKey(key)` method on the entity bean’s home interface.

Note that the Enterprise Beans architecture does not specify "`object equality`" (i.e. use of the == operator) for entity object references.
The result of comparing two object references using the Java programming language `Object.equals(Object obj)` method is unspecified.
Performing the `Object.hashCode()` method on two object references that represent the entity object is not guaranteed to yield the same result. 
Therefore, a client should always use the `isIdentical` method to determine if two entity object references refer to the same entity object.

****
_Note that the use of `isIdentical` for the comparison of object references applies to the implementation of the methods of the `java.util.Collection` API as well._
****

=== Entity Bean’s Remote Interface

A client can access an entity object through the entity bean’s remote interface.
An entity bean’s remote interface must extend the `jakarta.ejb.EJBObject`
interface.
A remote interface defines the business methods that are callable by remote clients.

The following example illustrates the definition of an entity bean’s remote interface:
[source, java]
----
public interface Account extends jakarta.ejb.EJBObject {
    void debit(double amount)
        throws java.rmi.RemoteException,
            InsufficientBalanceException;
    void credit(double amount)
        throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
    double getBalance()
        throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
----

The `jakarta.ejb.EJBObject` interface defines the methods that allow the client to perform the following operations on an entity object’s reference:

* Obtain the remote home interface for the entity object.

* Remove the entity object.

* Obtain the entity object’s handle.

* Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

The container provides the implementation of the methods defined in the `jakarta.ejb.EJBObject` interface.
Only the business methods are delegated to the instances of the enterprise bean class.

Note that the entity object does not expose the methods of the `jakarta.ejb.EnterpriseBean` interface to the client.
These methods are not intended for the client—they are used by the
container to manage the enterprise bean instances.

=== Entity Bean’s Local Interface

A local client can access an entity object through the entity bean’s local interface.
An entity bean’s local interface must extend the `jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalObject` interface.
A local interface defines the business methods that are callable by local clients.

The following example illustrates the definition of an entity bean’s local interface:
[source, java]
----
public interface Account extends jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalObject {
    void debit(double amount)
        throws InsufficientBalanceException;
    void credit(double amount);
    double getBalance();
}
----

_Note that the methods of the entity bean’s
local interface must not throw the `java.rmi.RemoteException`._

The `jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalObject` interface defines the methods that allow the local client to perform the following operations on an entity object’s local reference:

* Obtain the local home interface for the entity object.

* Remove the entity object.

* Obtain the entity object’s primary key.

The container provides the implementation of
the methods defined in the `jakarta.ejb.EJBLocalObject` interface.
Only the business methods are delegated to the instances of the enterprise bean class.

Note that the entity object does not expose the methods of the `jakarta.ejb.EntityBean` or the optional `jakarta.ejb.TimedObject` interface to the local client.
These methods are not intended for the local client—they are used by the container to manage the enterprise bean instances.

[[a349]]
=== Entity Bean’s Handle

An entity object’s handle is an object that identifies the entity object on a network.
A client that has a reference to an entity object’s remote interface can obtain the entity object’s handle by invoking the `getHandle` method on the remote interface.
The `getHandle` method is only available on the remote interface.

Since a handle class extends `java.io.Serializable`, a client may serialize the handle.
The client may use the serialized handle later, possibly in a different process or even system, to re-obtain a reference to the entity object identified by the handle.

The client code must use the `javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow` method to convert the result of the `getEJBObject` method invoked on a handle to the entity bean’s remote interface type.

The lifetime and scope of a handle is specific to the handle implementation.
At the minimum, a program running in one JVM must be able to obtain and serialize the handle, and another program running in a different JVM must be able to deserialize it and re-create an object reference.
An entity handle is typically implemented to be usable over a long period of time—it must be usable at least across a server restart.

_Containers that store long-lived entities will typically provide handle implementations that allow clients to store a handle for a long time (possibly many years).
Such a handle will be usable even if parts of the technology used by the container (e.g. ORB, DBMS, server) have been upgraded or replaced while the client has stored the handle.
Support for this "`quality of service`" is not required by the Enterprise Beans specification._

An Enterprise Beans container is not required to accept a handle that was generated by another vendor’s Enterprise Beans container.

The use of a handle is illustrated by the following example:
[source, java]
----
// A client obtains a handle of an account entity object and
// stores the handle in stable storage.
//
ObjectOutputStream stream = ...;
Account account = ...;
Handle handle = account.getHandle();
stream.writeObject(handle);

// A client can read the handle from stable storage, and use the
// handle to resurrect an object reference to the
// account entity object.

A handle is not a capability, in the security sense, that would automatically grant its holder the right to invoke methods on the object.
When a reference to an object is obtained from a handle, and then a method on the object is invoked, the container performs the usual access checks based on the caller’s principal.

=== Entity Home Handles

The Enterprise Beans specification allows a client to obtain a handle for the remote home interface.
The client can use the home handle to store a reference to an entity bean’s remote home interface in stable storage, and re-create the reference later.
This handle functionality may be useful to a client that needs to use the remote home interface in the future, but does not know the JNDI name of the remote home interface.

A handle to a remote home interface must implement the `jakarta.ejb.HomeHandle` interface.

The client code must use the `javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow` method to convert the result of the `getEJBHome` method invoked on a handle to the home interface type.

The lifetime and scope of a handle is specific to the handle implementation.
At a minimum, a program running in one JVM must be able to serialize the handle, and another program running in a different JVM must be able to deserialize it and re-create an object reference.
An entity handle is typically implemented to be usable over a long period of time—it must be usable at least across a server restart.

=== Type Narrowing of Object References

A client program that is intended to be interoperable with all compliant Enterprise Beans container implementations must use the `javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow` method to perform type-narrowing of the client-side representations of the remote home and remote interfaces.

_Note: Programs that use the cast operator to narrow the remote and remote home interfaces are likely to fail if the container implementation uses RMI-IIOP as the underlying communication transport._
